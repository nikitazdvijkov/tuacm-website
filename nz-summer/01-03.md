## 1. HTML & CSS

### Do:

1. Watch https://youtu.be/bWPMSSsVdPk as an intro to HTML, but don't write your `hr` tags the way he does; this is the proper way today: `<hr>` (no closing tag for this one).
2. Watch https://youtu.be/0afZj1G0BIE as an intro to CSS.

### Takeaways:

Know this vocab: 
- HTML tag
- HTML attribute 
- HTML entity
- CSS property
- CSS selector

Also &mdash; Know that generally in HTML/CSS the `class` attribute is used to target multiple parts of a document (e.g. all the paragraphs), while the `id` attribute is used to target a single thing (e.g. the biography section heading in a wikipedia article).

## 2. Bootstrap

Bootstrap is "the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS library in the world".

1. Go to https://getbootstrap.com/.
2. Click get started button. 
3. Scroll down to starter template. Copy that into a `.html` file. I recommend you install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for a text editor at this point. It's the most popular one right now.
4. Save the file. Right click > open with browser. You should 

Try:
- Right click on a webpage > view source
- Right click on a webpage > inspect element

Try the above on a couple of my projects: https://nznz.me/ and https://nikitazdvijkov.com/fred

To learn Bootstrap, read the documentation on the website: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/card/
