## 1. HTML & CSS

### Do:

1. Watch https://youtu.be/bWPMSSsVdPk as an intro to HTML, but don't write your `hr` tags the way he does; this is the proper way today: `<hr>` (no closing tag for this one).
2. Watch https://youtu.be/0afZj1G0BIE as an intro to CSS.

### Takeaways:

Know this vocab: 
- HTML tag
- HTML attribute 
- HTML entity
- CSS property
- CSS selector

Also &mdash; Know that generally in HTML/CSS the `class` attribute is used to target multiple parts of a document (e.g. all the paragraphs), while the `id` attribute is used to target a single thing (e.g. the biography section heading in a wikipedia article).

## 2. Bootstrap

Bootstrap is "the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS library in the world".

1. Go to https://getbootstrap.com/.
2. Click get started button. 
3. Scroll down to starter template. Copy that into a `.html` file. I recommend you install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for a text editor at this point. It's the most popular one right now.
4. Save the file. Right click > open with browser. You should 

Try:
- Right click on a webpage > view source
- Right click on a webpage > inspect element

Try the above on a couple of my projects: https://nznz.me/ and https://nikitazdvijkov.com/fred

To learn Bootstrap, read the documentation on the website: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/card/

## 3. Bonus

https://fonts.google.com/

Try using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for fonts and [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons.

## 4. Multiple page website

This assumes that you're starting from scratch.

1. Make a directory named `my-website`.
2. Put a file in there named `index.html`. When someone visits http://your-website.com/, this is the webpage they will see.
3. Within `my-website`, make a directory named `about`. 
4. Put a file in `my-website/about/` named `index.html`. When someone visits http://your-website.com/about/, this is the webpage they will see.

After following above steps your file structure should look like this:

```tree
my-website
├── index.html
└── about
    └── index.html
```

Note: if you're linking between pages on the same domain, it's better for portability (you can move website to another domain without breaking links) and development (you can use http://localhost without breaking links) &ndash; if you omit the domain name from the beginning of the `href` attribute URLs that link within the same website. For example, to link to about page from homepage, do this: 

```html
<a href="/about/">My about page.</a>
```

Don't do this:

```html
<a href="http://example.com/about/index.html">My about page.</a>
```

Also &ndash; omit the `index.html` at the end of the links as shown above.
