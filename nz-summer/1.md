# First Assignment &middot; May 26, 2020

## 1. Buy a domain through NameCheap.

From what I've read, NameCheap seems to be the favorite registrar among professional devs. I use it, and I've had no problems. That's why I recommend it.

Use "best mode" domain search:

At checkout &mdash; Keep WhoisGuard on (it's free forever). They will try to upsell you Premium DNS, Web Hosting, Positive SSL, and Email Hosting. Don't buy those &ndash; I will show you free alternatives.

## 2. Build webpage from scratch using HTML & CSS.

### Do:

1. Watch https://youtu.be/bWPMSSsVdPk as an intro to HTML, but don't write your `hr` tags the way he does; this is the proper way today: `<hr>` (no closing tag for this one).
2. Watchhttps://youtu.be/0afZj1G0BIE as an intro to CSS.

### Takeaways:

Know this vocab: 
- HTML tag
- HTML attribute 
- HTML entity
- CSS property
- CSS selector

Also &mdash; Know that generally in HTML/CSS the `class` attribute is used to target multiple parts of a document (e.g. all the paragraphs), while the `id` attribute is used to target a single thing (e.g. the biography section heading in a wikipedia article).

Heads up: you will create many accounts; keep track of passwords.
1. Go to namecheap.com; find yourself a domain using "beast mode" (see pic below); buy it. Note that the prices are per year. I recommend buying one based on your name to use for a personal website.
2. If you don't know HTML/CSS, watch this video: https://youtu.be/bWPMSSsVdPk -- but don't write your hr tags the way he does; this is the proper way today: <hr> (no closing tag for this one). For CSS, watch this video: https://youtu.be/0afZj1G0BIE – Make sure you know what the following vocab means, google if you don't -- HTML tag, HTML attribute, HTML entity, CSS property, CSS selector.  The best resource for HTML/CSS is https://www.w3schools.com/ --
3. If you already know HTML/CSS, go to https://getbootstrap.com/ -- click the get started button – scroll down to starter template -- copy that into an HTML file -- right click > open with browser -- then go to the documentation on the Bootstrap website and begin playing around with it. Use inspect element browser feature (or right click > view source) to examine my website: https://nznz.me/
