				<p><i>This is the fourth article in the </i>Making Sense of C<i> series.
					In this article, we're going to come up with the requirements for a basic
					program so that we can figure out what features we need to implement in C.
					This article will serve as an intermission of sorts, so it's not going to be too
					long or cover as many topics.
					</i>
				</p>
				<p>As always, there's a (sort of) relevant xkcd for our situation.
				</p>
				<div class="text-center">
					<a href="https://xkcd.com/1425/">
						<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tasks.png" alt="The xkcd comic 'Tasks'.">
					</a>
				</div>
				<p>In our case, a lot of the difficulty will come from a difference between what we
					as humans consider easy and what computers consider easy.
					For example, reading a million books is almost impossible for humans to do in a
					reasonable amount of time, but trivial for computers.
					Understanding a single sentence, however, is trivial for humans and extremely
					hard for computers to do.
					Likewise, recognizing elements in a picture or finding patterns in data are
					difficult for computers, but easy for humans.
				</p>
				<p>Anyway, the point of this whole discussion is to emphasize that programs you
					might think will be easy to write may be way harder than you would expect.
					For example, making a game, even a small one, is an insanely huge task.
					In fact, it's such a huge task that almost all game development tutorials will
					tell you to use a game engine, or at least a rendering engine.
					I know of exactly one <a
					href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT">in-depth
					tutorial on how to make a game engine</a>, and even then it requires that you
					know <a
					href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb"><code>C++</code></a>
					and <a
					href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2">OpenGL</a>.
					Luckily, TheChernoProject has tutorials for all three.
					Besides the actual code, you'll have to do all the artwork, sound design, etc.
					on your own.
				</p>
				<p>Of course, companies make games all the time after writing all their own code,
					but you have to remember that these companies have millions of dollars to pay
					multiple teams of experienced developers, artists, actors, etc. to make a game.
					As a novice programmer in <code>C</code>, you don't want to bite off more than you can
					chew, so we're going to try to come up with a program simple enough for you to
					write without understanding linear algebra, physics, collision detection
					algorithms, networking, etc., but complex enough to where you need to come up
					with features you would need in <code>C</code>.
				</p>
				<h2 id="projects-we-wont-do-for-now">Projects We Won't Do (For Now!)</h2>
				<p>First, anything to do with graphics, images, or audio is out.
					While most graphical and audio software is written in <code>C</code> or <code>C++</code> in one way or
					another (even if it's written in <code>python</code>, it still uses <code>C</code> or <code>C++</code> under the
					hood through the libraries used and the interpreter), graphics processing
					requires you to, at the very least, understand the format of different file
					types, know how to use the GPU, understand shaders, linear algebra, etc., while
					audio processing would require you to learn stuff like Fourier Transforms if you
					wanted to do anything cool.
				</p>
				<p>Once again, most software involving graphics uses <code>C</code> or <code>C++</code>, it's just that
					you as a beginner would have a hard time trying to make any graphical software.
				</p>
				<p>Second, anything specific to an operating system is out for now (though we might
					try to implement platform specific software in a cross-platform way later in the
					series) because I don't want anyone reading this tutorial to end up unable to go
					any further.
				</p>
				<p>Third, anything involving a computer understanding a natural language like
					English or Spanish is out because natural language processing is still an active
					area of research.
					We can still read English text, we just can't require it to understand why the
					sentence <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorless_green_ideas_sleep_furiously">Colorless
					green ideas sleep furiously</a> is meaningless.
				</p>
				<p>Rudimentary text-based games would not fall into the previous category, but we
					still shouldn't do them for now because a full text-based game might be too
					large for a beginner.
				</p>
				<p>Lastly, anything involving a ton of math or theory (AI, Machine Learning,
					Statistics, Numerical Methods, etc.) is out.
					While you should learn a lot of relevant math and CS theory if you want to be a
					great programmer, we have to take things one step at a time.
				</p>
				<h2 id="what-projects-can-we-do">What Projects Can We Do?</h2>
				<p>I have four related projects that I think are simple enough for us to implement
					but require us to set up the features of the language.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Given some text and a word, count the number of times the word shows up in the
						text.
					</li>
					<li>Given some text and a word, print out every line containing that word and the
						line number.
					</li>
					<li>Given some text, print out every word and the number of times it occurs in the
						text.
					</li>
					<li>Given some text, print out the probability that a word follows another word
						(calculating the actual probability is pretty easy).
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For example, if the first program is given the text "The quick brown fox jumps
					over the lazy dog." and the word "the", it should print out <code>2</code>.
					If the second program is given the text (Gettysburg Address) below

met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of
that field, as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives, that
that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do
this. But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate—we cannot
hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have
consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little
note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did
here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished
work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather
for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from
these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here
gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these
dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new

				<p>where each line follows the format <code>[first word] [second word]: [probability
					that second word comes after first word],&#8203;[number of times second
					word follows first word]</code>.
				</p>
				<h2 id="why-choose-these-projects">Why Choose These Projects?</h2>
				<p>I'm in a weird situation where I don't want to come up with any contrived usage
					for features in <code>C</code>, but I still want to bring in features from <code>C</code>.
					I think this project strikes the right balance is simple enough for a beginner
					to do but still useful enough for anyone who wants to do things like machine
					learning for natural language processing.
				</p>
				<h2 id="coming-up-with-the-features-we-need">Coming Up With the Features We Need</h2>
				<p>Now that we've decided what we want to do, we need to come up with the features
					we need for each project.
					Once we've come up with the features we need, we can then start discussing how
					we can implement them.
				</p>
				<h3 id="first-project">First Project</h3>
				<p>For the first project, we need to be able to count, so we're going to need some
					basic arithmetic and some way of storing the count.
					We're also going to need a way to print our results to the screen and read from
					a file.
					We'll also need some way of changing what words and what files we use.
					Finally, we'll also need to come up with some way to get individual words from
					text, which means we'll have to write our own basic parsing algorithm.
				</p>
				<h3 id="second-project">Second Project</h3>
				<p>We'll need everything from the first project and we'll need to expand our
					printing capabilities to more than just numbers.
					Lastly, since we don't want to fill up the screen with text, we'll need some way
					to write data to files.
				</p>
				<h3 id="third-project">Third Project</h3>
				<p>This project is similar to the first project, except we'll need to do the first
					project for every word.
					While we could do this project inefficiently by writing a program that finds all
					the words in the file and then runs the first project for every word, we're
					going to introduce and implement a <b>hash table</b>, which will organize our
					data in such a way that we can efficiently read and write it.
				</p>
				<h3 id="fourth-project">Fourth Project</h3>
				<p>This last project will require everything from the third project plus floating
					point numbers to represent a probability.
					We'll also have to change up our algorithm a bit.
				</p>
				<h3 id="other-features">Other Features</h3>
				<p>In implementing these features, we're going to end up needing other features
					from the language, but <a
					href="https://malaphors.com/2013/01/17/well-burn-that-bridge-when-we-come-to-it/">we'll
					burn those bridges when we come to it</a>.
				</p>
				<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
				<p>Up to this point, we've decided that we're going to put our code into a file and
					give compiler the name of the file so it can turn it into machine code.
					We've also established that we can use comments with <code>//</code> or <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> to
					tell the compiler to ignore sections of the file and that our file will consist
					of a series of statements separated by semicolons.
				</p>
				<p>In this article, we started moving away from just adding features we think we'll
					probably need to come up with clear goals that will help us figure out what
					features we need.
					We decided to stay with numerical and text-based projects for now, since those
					projects would be easiest for a beginner but still require us to have the
					necessary features for the language.
					We decided that <code>C</code> should have the ability to
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>perform basic arithmetic (including counting),
					</li>
					<li>store values for later use,
					</li>
					<li>handle text,
					</li>
					<li>change the behavior of a program by giving it different inputs,
					</li>
					<li>read from a file,
					</li>
					<li>print numbers to the screen,
					</li>
					<li>store things in a list,
					</li>
					<li>print text to a screen,
					</li>
					<li>write data to files,
					</li>
					<li>and perform floating point calculations.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Since we're putting ourselves in the shoes of Ritchie et al, we're going to
					design <code>C</code> in such a way that we can use all these features.
				</p>
				<h2 id="whats-next">What's Next</h2>
				<p>While we could start with almost any feature of the language, we'll start simple
					with some <a href="../04-variables/index.html">basic arithmetic and storing values for later use</a>.
