<i>This is the fourteenth article in the </i>Making Sense of C<i> series.
In this article, we're going to discuss text editors, how to use a compiler as
part of an IDE, and how to use an IDE.</i>

In the last article, we established that we had four things left to do before we
could write our first program:

\{{ul}}

set up and use a compiler,

familiarize ourselves with an IDE/text editor,

figure out a way to print something out to the terminal,

and figure out a way to read from a file.

\{{\ul}}

In this article, we're going to discuss the main components of an IDE:

\{{ul}}

the project file,

the compiler,

the code executor (i.e. the thing that runs the code),

the text editor,

the file manager,

the output windows.

# General Features of an IDE

In this section, we're going to discuss features that are common across pretty
much all IDEs.
To start, an IDE is a program that can do almost anything you would need to do
to write a program.
In fact, IDE is short for <b>Integrated Development Environment</b>, which means
it's a singular programming environment that allows you to write, compile, run,
and debug code within it.

An IDE will try to look like programs you're used to like, Microsoft Word,
Excel, or Google Docs.
I've made a simplified version of an IDE below.

If the image above looks weird on your phone, turn it sideways.

As you can see, the top of the IDE will have tabs like "File" and "View" plus
the minimize, maximize, and close buttons, which will work just like they work
in almost every other program.
Under that, you have a bunch of buttons that do things like save your current
file, undo something, redo something, build the project, do stuff with files,
run the program, and search through the project for some sort of text.
You'll also have a project explorer that will display all the relevant files in
the project, which mainly consist of source code files, on the left.
To the right of the project explorer, you'll have a text editor with some syntax
highlighting.
You type your code in the text editor and save it as you would normally expect.
Under that, you have at least two tabs: one for the output of building the
project (which include which files were compiled and any warnings or errors
that showed up) and one for the output of the program itself.

To be clear, most IDEs have the features I've described, though they allow users
to do things like move each of the windows around, add and remove tabs, add
buttons, etc.

## The Project File

Since we want to save information about how to compile our source code and send
that information to other people, we need some sort of project file.
The project file consists of anything your computer needs to know about to
compile your project properly.
It includes a list of all the source code files (code that you write), libraries
(code that other people have written and compiled for you that you can use in
your own projects), and directories you want to include in your project.
It also includes information you can tell the compiler about how you want to
compile projects.
If you're using an IDE, you will go through the settings in the IDE to modify
the file.
When you compile and link your project, it will go through the project file and
figure out what to compile and how to compile it.

While the project file is important under the hood, you as a programmer probably
don't need to worry about it directly.
In most IDEs, you'll find the ability to create a new project by going to
<b>File</b> (Top Left Corner) {{gt}} <b>New</b> {{gt}} <b>Project</b>.
You can add source files by right-clicking on the project name in the project
explorer (which you can find in either <b>View</b> or <b>Window</b> in the bar
at the top of the screen with <b>File</b> and clicking something like <b>Add New
File</b> or <b>Add</b> {{gt}} <b>File</b>).

These project files are often platform specific, so people will use tools like
{cmake} and {premake} to generate project files for each platform so you don't
have to worry about it.

## The Compiler

We'll also want some way of compiling the code within the IDE, so we're going to
build a compiler into the program or let the user modify the project to use a
specific compiler.
Either way, we're going to have a button somewhere on the screen that will
compile the code and we're probably going to have a tab at the top of the screen
titled something like <b>Build</b>.

After compiling a file, the IDE will save the compiled file (known as an object
file) so that it doesn't have to recompile the entire project every time.
The project file and the compiler will work together to only compile what needs
to be compiled, which consists of pretty much any source code file that has
changed since it was last compiled or any source code file that doesn't have a
corresponding object file.
You won't see much of a difference for smaller projects, but larger projects can
sometimes take hours to compile from scratch.

All IDEs have four major options to build code:

\{{ul}}

<b>Build:</b> Compiles all the modified and new files and links everything
together to get you a working executable.

<b>Clean:</b> Gets rid of all the object files so that you compile all the files
the next time you <b>Build</b> your project.

<b>Rebuild:</b> Recompiles all the files specified in the project file and links
everything together.
You can get the same results by running <b>Clean</b> then <b>Build</b>.

<b>Compile:</b> Compile a specific file without linking it.

\{{\ul}}

In general, you want to <b>Build</b> your code unless something weird happened
and you need to <b>Rebuild</b> your code.
Most IDEs will have a button somewhere that looks like a hammer or some other
tool you would use to build something that will allow you to build code.
Also, building will often save any unsaved files, but not necessarily.

## The Code Executor

Compiling is cool and all, but you need to be able to run your code to make sure
it actually works.
So somewhere on the screen you'll see a Play button that will run your code.
Sometimes, it will also save your unsaved files and build what it needs to
build.
There's also an option to run the code in the toolbar at the top, but different
IDEs have it in different places, but <b>Run</b> is a good start if it exists.
There's also a version of the code executor called the debugger that will run
the code, but you can tell it to do certain things like watch variables or stop
at a certain point in the code so you can look at the entire program step by
step and see what's going wrong.
It often uses a Bug icon if it's in the button toolbar, but you can also find it
anywhere you can run the code.
For example, if you have a play button, it could have a drop down menu to the
right that will have the option to run the debugger.
If you have a <b>Run</b> tab at the top of the IDE, you'll find the ability to
run the debugger in that tab.

## The Text Editor

You write your code in this window.
Text editors have several features, most notably syntax highlighting, auto
indentation, some form of autocomplete, an error checking mechanism, line
numbers, etc.
They also allow you to edit multiple files at once using tabs like tabs in a
browser.

## The File Manager

The file manager works just like you would expect.
It allows you to create files, open files, edit files, etc.
It's pretty much contained in the <b>File</b> tab at the top of the screen and
the project manager.

## The Output Windows

These windows serve as output for different parts of the IDE.
You'll always have one for outputting the status of the build, which consists of
which files were compiled and any warnings or errors found.
You can also have another window that prints out the result of your program.

## Other Features

You can often change settings all you want, import plugins, change the
background and the colors used in syntax highlighting, etc.
I recommend that you should change the background to some form of dark mode or
use a theme with a dark background.

# Which IDE to Use?

The IDE you use barely matters.
They all have the same core features and everything else they have is just a
minor feature that might make you develop faster, though some IDEs might be
faster than other IDEs.
The compiler does matter, however.
Most compilers are platform dependent, so {gcc} won't compile programs for
Windows and the {Visual C++} compiler will only compile programs for Windows.
In short, you need to make sure to pick an IDE that allows you to compile for
your system and your target system.

## Windows

{{wsl}}:="<a href="https://github.com/michaeltreat/Windows-Subsystem-For-Linux-Setup-Guide/blob/master/readmes/01_preface.md">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>"

If you're on Windows, you should either use a cross platform IDE like Eclipse or
Netbeans or install some form of Linux, which you can do by setting up the
{{wsl}} or by <a
href="https://tuacm.com/blog/virtual-box-shared-folder-clipboard">installing a
virtual machine like Virtual Box</a> and installing Linux on the virtual
machine.
If you choose to set up either the Windows Subsystem for Linux or install the
Virtual Machine with a Linux distro, you can use the terminal to install the
{gcc} compiler (which is necessary for a lot of programs to properly install, so
you might as well install it) and you can install {mingw} to build programs for
Windows in {C}.
If you compile something with {gcc}, then it will work within the Linux part of
your computer, which includes the Windows Subsytem for Linux or within the
virtual machine.
If you compile something with {mingw}, then it will work on the Windows part of
your computer.
If you want graphical output, you have to install a virtual machine.
If you want to use Eclipse on Windows, someone else has already written an
article on <a
href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/How-do-I-set-up-C-Cplusplus-on-Eclipse-in-Windows">setting
up Eclipse in Windows for C/C++ development</a>.

I threw a lot at you, so if you feel confused at any point, here's the simplest
way to get our basic {C} programs to compile on Windows:

\{{ol}}

Set up the {{wsl}} using the linked tutorial.
Follow the entire process in the tutorial except for setting up {npm},
{Node.js}, or {ESlint} since those are JavaScript things that we won't need for
programming in {C} at all.

Download either VSCode or Sublime Text (the specific text editor doesn't
matter as long as you have at least one).

In the Ubuntu App, type the command {sudo apt install gcc g++ gdb git make} to
install all the programs after the word {install} (you probably already have
several of them, but it's good to make sure that you have them).

\{{\ol}}

That's it.

## Linux

If you're on Linux, you should probably use a decent text editor like VSCode
Sublime Text and the command line for everything else, though you might be able
to integrate everything into the text editor, though it's more work on your
part.

## MacOS

If you're on Mac, you should probably use XCode or anything that works on Linux.
MacOS also has a terminal that works almost exactly like the Linux terminal
(both were based of the Unix System), so you can use a decent text editor and
the terminal just like in Linux.

# Which IDE Does the Author Use?

I use Linux, so I use {gcc} in the terminal with a separate text editor and a
project file known as a {Makefile}, which is what you will use if you set up the
{{wsl}} (Seriously read that tutorial.).
The command line also serves as my file manager, code executor, debugger, and
everything else.
The file manager and the code executor are some of the basic functions of the
terminal, while the debugger is a separate command line program, {gdb}.

# Summary

I want to emphasize again that only whether you can compile your code, run your
code on the target system, debug your code, and manage your files matters when
choosing an IDE.
Other than that, most IDEs share probably 95% of the things you would want in an
IDE, so the choice is over the 5% of features you don't even need.
For this tutorial, we're going to be focused on using a terminal with an
external text editor since

\{{ul}}

you either have a terminal built into your OS (Linux and MacOS) or you can
emulate a terminal using the Windows Subsystem for Linux or a virtual machine,

the best IDE for Windows, Visual Studio, barely supports {C} (if we were
learning in {C++}, I would absolutely recommend it),

setting up any of the IDEs mentioned in this article for {C} development is
harder than using a command line,

knowing the command line is a much better skill to have than knowing the
location of the right button to build a project (though you should still know
the terms <b>Build</b>, <b>Rebuild</b>, <b>Clean</b>, and <b>Compile</b>) or
where to change a specific setting,

and I would have to spend time on at least three articles for each IDE that most
readers won't read simply because they'll only need to install one IDE.

\{{\ul}}

though we will try to indicate where and how to compile programs using other
IDEs.
If anyone wants to write an article on setting up a specific IDE for {C} and
writing programs in it, contact us at <a
href="mailto:thetuacm@gmail.com">thetuacm@gmail.com</a> and we can talk more
about it.

# What's Next

We just need to figure out how to print something to the terminal and how to
read from a file and we can write our first program (and pretty much any other
program).
Now, if we were coming up with the {C} language from scratch, we would have to
write these functions for the standard library, making them specific to the
operating system and CPU architecture, which would be annoying.
Luckily for us, we're never going to need to write these functions because
someone else has already written these functions.
The next article will be explaining the single line of code we're going to put
into our program to allow us to read from files and print things out to the
terminal.
