				<p><i>This article is the first article in the </i>Making Sense of C<i> series.</i>
				</p>
				<p>Most programming tutorials seem to take three approaches:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>The Dictionary Approach:</b> Here are all the keywords in a language and
						here's what they do, and here are some syntax rules.
						We'll also provide some minimal examples.
					</li>
					<li><b>The One-Off Approach:</b> Here's how to implement a specific data structure
						or algorithm in a programming language.
						We'll assume that you already know the language since we are writing for people
						who already know the language.
					</li>
					<li><b>The Toy Approach:</b> Here's how to use a toy module within the language
						that you will never use once you finish this tutorial.
						(I'm thinking of <a
						href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle">Python's
						turtle module</a>, which is what my high school CS class taught.)
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>While these tutorials have their use, none of these approaches will teach you
					how to program.
					To see why, forget programming for a second and consider what a tutorial for
					learning a foreign language would look like if it tried to teach the language
					like a programming tutorial.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>The Dictionary Approach:</b> Here are all the words in Spanish and here's
						what they mean.
						Also, here are some rules you need to follow to write a <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorless_green_ideas_sleep_furiously">grammatically
						valid sentence</a>.
						We'll also include a few simple, but extremely contrived sample sentences.
					</li>
					<li><b>The One-Off Approach:</b> Here's a book in Japanese with a few annotations in
						your native language.
					</li>
					<li><b>The Toy Approach:</b> Here's an imaginary restaurant with specific rules on
						how to order that we made up to teach you Swedish.
						To eat at this restaurant, you have to ask for food with grammatically correct
						sentences that use words we made up for this scenario.
						Most of these words you must use are not part of the language.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>I personally learned from working on several projects, using the <b>Dictionary
					Approach</b> when I needed to know about a specific feature and the <b>One-Off
					Approach</b> to expose me to a new thing to learn.
					I also went through the <b>Toy Approach</b>, but I didn't learn much from it.
					Plus, I can only name one tutorial or class that used the <b>Toy Approach</b>,
					so I won't focus on it.
					I can't speak for everyone, but given that I was unable to find any tutorials
					for <code>C</code> in the first two pages of Google's search results that didn't follow
					these approaches, I don't think I'm an exception.
				</p>
				<p>Now, experienced programmers know of an exception to the approaches I listed
					for tutorials on the <code>C</code> programming language: Brian Kernighan and Dennis
					Ritchie's book <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language"><i>The C
					Programming Language</i></a>.
					This book, written by the creators of <code>C</code> themselves, is a good resource for
					<code>C</code> programming.

					<h4>Historical Accuracy</h4>
					<hr>
					<p><b>This tutorial does not intend to be a history lesson</b>, but I will make it
						clear when I'm making a historically incorrect claim with an explanation off to
						the side.
						My goal with this tutorial is to help you understand <code>C</code>, which may mean
						simplifying the history of <code>C</code>.
						For example, <code>C</code>'s direct predecessor, <code>B</code>, had plenty of influence on the syntax
						of <code>C</code>, as did several other languages.
						However, <code>B</code>'s influence on <code>C</code> isn't necessary to understand the design
						decisions of <code>C</code>, so I probably won't mention it that often.
					</p>
					<p>In fact, I'm going to present the historical development of <code>C</code> as a linear
						progression of
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Machine code/pure binary instructions.
						</li>
						<li>Assembly language.
						</li>
						<li>The <code>C</code> programming language.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Once again, there are tons of programming languages that had an influence on
						<code>C</code> (<code>B</code>, <code>BCPL</code>, <code>CPL</code>, and the <code>ALGOL</code> family) and there were previous
						programming languages that had little to do with <code>C</code> (<code>FORTRAN</code>).
					</p>
					<p>If you do want to read about the history of <code>C</code>, check out Dennis Ritchie's <a
						href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html">paper on the evolution
						of <code>C</code></a>.
						It also does a good job of explaining design choices for the language.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h1 id="the-problems-c-needs-to-solve">The Problems <code>C</code> Needs to Solve</h1>
				<p>Since I neither want to write yet another <code>C</code> dictionary nor rehash <i>The C
					Programming Language</i>, this tutorial will explain why <code>C</code> is the way it is by
					looking at the problems Ritchie et al faced when designing the <code>C</code> language
					and how <code>C</code> solved them.
					In other words, we're not just going to list all the syntax in <code>C</code>, we're going
					to build the language from the ground up.
				</p>
				<p>This tutorial will also:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>present topics in <code>C</code> in such a way that you only need to read the previous
						articles in the series to understand the article.
					</li>
					<li>describe good general programming practices, but with a specific emphasis on
						<code>C</code>.
					</li>
					<li>discuss how to safely program in <code>C</code>.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>At the end of this tutorial, you shouldn't just know the features and syntax of
					<code>C</code>, but how you should use them to write good <code>C</code> code.
				</p>
				<h2 id="why-not-use-machine-code">Why Not Use Machine Code?</h2>
				<p>First, let's talk about a program from the computer's perspective.
					Most, if not all computers use a <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">von Neumann
					architecture</a>, which means, when given a program, it will:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Fetch current instruction from memory.
					</li>
					<li>Perform current instruction.
					</li>
					<li>Move to next instruction.
					</li>
					<li>Repeat.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>where instructions are basic operations (like addition or fetching memory) that
					are performed directly by the CPU, ALU, or GPU.
				</p>
				<div class="aside" >
					<p>Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5JC9Ve1sfI">Tom Scott's video on what your
						computer actually does</a> for a more in depth explanation.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>Of course, it gets a little more complicated once you introduce stuff like
					threads, vectorized instructions, and other forms of parallelism, but it's
					still the same basic process.
					To actually get a program running, it needs to be in machine code, so why not
					just write our programs in machine code?
				</p>
				<h3 id="machine-code-is-completely-unintelligible">Machine Code is Completely Unintelligible</h3>
				<p>To see why programming in machine code was painful, consider the following
					example that I pulled from David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy's
					<i>Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface</i>, Fifth
					Edition (p. A-5):

				<p>Unless you've written a MIPS assembler, you will not be able to tell me what
					the program does.
					Also, you probably wouldn't be able to write the program like this, as every
					eight bits would be a byte (basically, a character) and there would be no
					spaces or newlines.
					If you really wanted to, you could <a
					href="https://opencores.org/projects/plasma/opcodes">convert the instructions
					into an assembly language</a>.
				</p>
				<div class="aside" >
					<h4>Programming the First Computers</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>Fortunately, memory and register size on these early computers was small and
						they could only perform a few operations, meaning each of these instructions
						would have been between one and two bytes.
						Unfortunately, rendering text to the screen would have been too computationally
						inefficient for you to program in, so you would have to set all the memory in
						your program manually by flipping switches or using punch cards.
					</p>
					<p>If you want to see a video on what that would look like, Ben Eater made a <a
						href="https://youtu.be/a73ZXDJtU48">video</a> on it where he made a simple
						computer with sixteen bytes of memory and programmed it to calculate the
						Fibonacci numbers less than 256.
						He made a slight logic error in his code where it prints out before it
						calculates the next number, meaning it will calculate 233, but it will reset
						before it prints it out.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3 id="assembly-a-step-above-machine-code">Assembly: A Step Above Machine Code</h3>
				<p>As computers got more powerful, <a
					href="https://medium.com/a-computer-of-ones-own/kathleen-booth-machine-learning-pioneer-7cb8b2ed70c8">Kathleen
					Booth</a> figured that, instead of remembering all the binary instructions off
					the top of her head, she would write her code using keywords related to the
					instruction she wanted to run.
					For example, she would type something like <code>add $1, $2, $3</code> instead of typing
					some string of ones and zeros.
					She would then have to write a program to convert her code into machine
					language.
					In doing so, she wrote the first assembler for the first assembly language.
				</p>
				<p>To see the improvement, let's look at the bare bones MIPS version that directly
					converts to the program above:

				<p>This program can be converted into machine code quite easily, as each line has
					a one-to-one conversion rule.
					Assembly languages are much easier to follow than the machine code (<code>add-</code> does
					addition, <code>mult-</code> does multiplications, <code>j-</code> jumps around in the code, <code>s-</code>
					stores values in memory, <code>l-</code> loads values from memory, <code>$n</code> refers to register
					<code>n</code>, <code>stli</code> checks if the value is less than the other value, <code>b-</code> is a
					conditional branch a.k.a. an <code>if</code> statement, etc.), but it's still hard to
					read.
					The highlighted lines, for example, say "Set the value at the memory location
					<code>28($29)</code>, get the value at <code>28($29)</code>, increment it by one, check if it's less
					than 101, store the new value back in the specified memory location, jump
					backwards 9 lines from the next line to line 7 if it is, and go to the next
					line if it isn't."
					If you have any experience with programming, you may recognize this as a <code>for</code>
					loop with the iteration variable being the memory at <code>28($29)</code>.
					While you can improve assembly with stuff like macros, labels, ASCII text, and
					named registers instead of numbers, assembly languages suffer from a few
					fundamental flaws.
				</p>
				<h2 id="why-not-use-assembly">Why Not Use Assembly?</h2>
				<p>From the code snippet provided, it's easy to see several problems with writing
					code in assembly:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>To properly implement a loop that goes through a range of numbers, you need six
						instructions on six lines, minimum.
						To make matters worse, you need to write these lines whenever you want to make
						a for loop.
					</li>
					<li>You'll need to keep track of what's at which memory location, since you don't
						have identifiable variables.
					</li>
					<li>You'll need to manage which register holds what.
					</li>
					<li>If you were to add any code between line 7 and line 15, you would need to
						change the <code>-9</code> part of line 15 so that it goes to the proper line or use
						labels.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>There are several other issues with assembly languages, such as the use of <a
					href="http://david.tribble.com/text/goto.html">goto or jump</a> statements,
					which lead to what is known as <a
					href="https://www.docsity.com/en/news/programming-2/programming-pasta-spaghetti-lasagna-ravioli-macaroni-code/">spaghetti
					code</a>, code that is characterized by a bunch of nonlocal and nonlinear jumps
					throughout a program such that the control flow of the program is almost
					impossible to follow.
					If you were to draw the logical program flow of spaghetti code, you would get
					something that looks like a plate of spaghetti, hence the name.
					Spaghetti code is sometimes used as a general pejorative for bad code, but not
					all bad code is spaghetti code.
				</p>
				<div class="aside" >
					<h4>What's the Deal with Spaghetti Code?</h4>
					<hr>
					<p><b>Spaghetti code strips lines of code from their context.</b>
						If you run your code and you get an error on line 27, you won't be able to tell
						me what caused the error without diving deep into the code and following the
						execution from beginning to end.
						You also won't have any semblance of a call stack because you've turned the
						unit of execution into individual lines of code.
						Lastly, there's no semblance of what data each line of code can modify, so you
						end up with global variables.
					</p>
					<p>Ravioli code, on the other hand, uses functions to break code into separate
						modules that interact through well-defined interfaces, usually argument passing
						or some sort of shared state like in object oriented programming.
						Doing so leads to a linear program flow with only local jumps and local
						variables.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>All the tasks listed are menial tasks that you should be able to automate, but
					there's still one huge problem with writing code in assembly: it won't work on
					any CPU that does not accept the instruction set you wrote it in.
					The code provided will run on any system with the MIPS architecture, which
					doesn't include Intel, AMD, or any CPU you would find on a smartphone.
					Furthermore, you actually have <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings">different
					instructions available for different CPUs within the same architecture</a>,
					though most of the code is still similar.
					You just want to loop through a range of numbers, but you're going to have to
					learn multiple instruction sets to implement the same program.
				</p>
				<p>Ideally, you would like the computer to take care of these menial, but easy to
					automate tasks so that you can deal with the higher level algorithms and data
					organization.
				</p>
				<h2 id="the-purpose-of-programming-languages">The Purpose of Programming Languages</h2>
				<p>Just as Booth came up with the idea of using a program to convert something
					intelligible to machine code, people like <a
					href="https://scientificwomen.net/women/hopper-grace-45">Grace Hopper</a> came
					up with the idea of writing code in a more intelligible language, and then using
					a different program to convert it into assembly (or directly into machine
					code).
					In doing so, these people developed some of the first programming languages.
					Since they couldn't have a programming language without a compiler or
					interpreter, they also made compilers or interpreters for their language.  If
					you want to be able to use the language on a specific architecture, you can
					write your own compiler or modify your interpreter.
				</p>
				<div class="aside" >
					<h4>Compiled vs. Interpreted Language</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>A <b>compiled language</b> uses a compiler to convert source code into machine
						code, producing a whole new executable file.
						When you run the executable, you give the generated machine code directly to
						the operating system.
						You <b>do not need</b> the compiler to run the generated executable.
					</p>
					<p>An <b>interpreted language</b> uses an interpreter to read source code and the
						interpreter generates the proper machine code line by line.
						When you run the executable, you give the original source code to the
						interpreter, which then converts it line by line into machine code, which then
						gets sent to the operating system.
						You <b>do need</b> the interpreter to run the program, though you can almost
						always generate a standalone executable that comes with the interpreter built
						in.
					</p>
					<p>Since <code>C</code> is a compiled language, we will completely ignore interpreters and
						only talk about compilers, even if the claim we're making about compilers
						applies to interpreters.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><b>For a programming language to be useful, it has to distribute the work
					fairly between the compiler and the programmer.</b>
					The programmer should give the compiler enough information for it to generate
					the proper code and nothing more.
				</p>
				<h2 id="slow-computers-with-little-memory">Slow Computers with Little Memory</h2>
				<p>The first iteration of <code>C</code> was implemented on the <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-7">PDP-11</a> system, which had 24 KB
					of memory with 12 KB reserved for the Unix operating system.
					At best, you could get around 300,000 instructions per second.
					To put that into perspective, my low-end Intel i-5 laptop has an <a
					href="https://medium.com/software-design/why-software-developers-should-care-about-cpu-caches-8da04355bb8a">L1
					cache</a>, <b>1.5</b> times larger than the entire available memory of the
					PDP-11.
					In other words, the high speed memory built into the chip of my computer is
					large enough for me to simulate the entirety of the PDP-11.
					It can also handle around <a
					href="https://wikivisually.com/wiki/Instructions_per_second">53,000,000,000
					instructions per second</a>, which is around 180,000 times faster.
				</p>
				<p>If you want a programming language on the PDP-11, it has to be close to the
					metal and simple enough for the compiler itself to run on the machine.
					Neither the compiler nor the program itself can take up a ton of memory or
					time.
				</p>
				<p>In the modern era, most code doesn't run on the PDP-11, but instead advanced
					computers hundreds of thousands of times faster with multithreaded, multicore
					processors and around six orders of magnitude more RAM.
					<code>C</code> still has the low level access to memory and almost direct conversion into
					machine code that it did when it ran on the PDP-11, meaning it takes little
					memory and runs incredibly fast compared to many other languages.
					If you don't believe me, check out <a
					href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/">the
					benchmarks for different programming languages</a> for yourself.
				</p>
				<p>If you're programming embedded software, however, you're almost guaranteed to
					use either <code>C</code> or an assembly language because <code>C</code> was made for computers with
					little memory.
				</p>
				<h2 id="explicit-types-are-more-efficient-than-text">Explicit Types are More Efficient than Text</h2>
				<p>Types with defined rules are easier for the compiler to convert into machine
					code.
					For example, there are only 128 possible ASCII characters, (though there are
					extensions), so it would make sense to only use a byte for each character.
					Ten ASCII characters should take up ten bytes and a thousand characters should
					take up a thousand bytes.
					Integers and floating point numbers, however, require more memory.
				</p>
				<h2 id="a-standard-library">A Standard Library</h2>
				<p>There is a lot of basic functionality (such as printing things to a terminal or
					reading from a file) that everyone should be able to use if they need to use it
					without having to write the code themselves.
					While some wheels should be reinvented, printing stuff to the terminal should
					not.
					Furthermore, if your goal is to write code that can be compiled on any computer,
					you should take care of anything that could differ from computer to computer.
				</p>
				<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
				<p>For <code>C</code> to be a good programming language, it must
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>implement common programming patterns, such as looping through a set of values,
						looping until a condition is satisfied, and conditional branching.
					</li>
					<li>take care of menial tasks such as assigning memory locations to variables,
						managing which register performs which task, finding out where the program
						should get its next instruction (e.g. the <code>-9</code> in line 15 of the MIPS program).
					</li>
					<li>allow the user to define functions to help avoid spaghetti code.
					</li>
					<li>require the programmer to write as little as possible to get the job done.
					</li>
					<li>be simple enough for a programmer to learn.
					</li>
					<li>be simple enough to compile quickly with minimal memory usage.
					</li>
					<li>generate machine code that runs quickly with minimal memory usage.
					</li>
					<li>implement a standard library
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h1 id="whats-next">What's Next</h1>
				<p>We didn't actually discuss any specific features, design choices, or syntax of
					the <code>C</code> language in this article, but we did set up the ground work for what we
					need to accomplish to make the <code>C</code> language a good language.
					The rest of the articles in this series will discuss these topics in the order
					established below:
				</p>

				<p>Some of these topics may take an article or two and some of these topics may be
					merged into other topics, depending on how much I need to say about it and
					whether it fits in with another topic.
				</p>
				<p>Each topic will set the ground work for future topics.
					Every article will only require you to have read the previous articles to fully
