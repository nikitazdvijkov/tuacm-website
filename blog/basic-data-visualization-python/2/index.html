				</ul>
				<p>Since <b>How <code>python</code> Handles Statements</b> is a short but necessary topic, I'm
					including it within this article instead of putting it in its own article.
				</p>
				<h2 id="how-python-handles-statements">How <code>python</code> Handles Statements</h2>
				<p><code>python</code> will read your statements from top to bottom in the file.
				</p>
				<p>Unlike languages like <code>C</code>, <code>C++</code>, and <code>Java</code>, statements in <code>python</code> end when
					the line ends. Furthermore, instead of using curly braces, <code>python</code> uses
					indentation and a colon to indicate which statements are grouped together.
				</p>
				<p>Statements in <code>C</code>, <code>C++</code>, and <code>Java</code>:
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="n">statement</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="n">control_statement</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">statement</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">statement</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>Statements in <code>python</code>:
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="n">statement</span>

<span class="n">compound_statement</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">statement</span>
    <span class="n">statement</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>We'll go into more detail for the <code>compound_statement</code> syntax later in the
					<a href="../3/index.html">next article</a>.
				</p>
				<h2 id="experimenting">Experimenting</h2>
				<p>I encourage you to use the <code>python</code> interpreter to experiment with any of these
					concepts that I'll introduce in this article. You can start it up using the
					command <code>python3</code> in the terminal (Terminal/Terminal Emulator on Linux and Mac
					and the Ubuntu App if you're using the <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/tutorial-install-linux-on-windows-wsl/">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>. Read the linked article for how
					to set up the Windows Subsystem for Linux) like so:
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre><span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">user@comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">~/dev/py_data_vis</span></b>$ python3</span>
Python 3.7.3 (default, Mar 27 2019, 22:11:17)
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>The next three lines after you type Enter/Return are just version information
					about which python you're using. As long as you see a <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>,
					you're probably fine. You can then type any expression and see the result pop
					up. For example, if you were on MacOS and you wanted to see the result of <code>3 +
					2</code>, you would type
				</p>
				<div class="mac-terminal"><pre>
<span class="terminal-oneline">comp:py_data_vis user$ python3</span>
Python 3.7.3 (default, Mar 27 2019, 22:11:17)
[GCC 4.8.2] on mac
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 + 2
5
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>If you want to see the value of a variable, you can just type the name of the
					variable like so:
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre>
<span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">user@comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">~/dev/py_data_vis</span></b>$ python3</span>
Python 3.7.3 (default, Mar 27 2019, 22:11:17)
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 3 + 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
5
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>Once you're finished experimenting, exit using <code>Ctrl + D</code> to return to the
					terminal.
				</p>
				<h2 id="objects">Objects</h2>
				<p>Unlike languages like <code>C</code>, <code>C++</code>, and <code>Java</code>, there are no explicitly declared
					types. Instead (if you'll excuse the analogy), each variable is like a large box
					that can hold anything of any type inside it, where the box is completely
					separate from its contents. Objects can have types, but the variables themselves
					do not. When you use a variable in your code, the <code>python</code> interpreter will take
					whatever object is stored in the variable and do what the code says to do.
				</p>
				<p>You can assign variables using the syntax <code>[variable] = [Object]</code>, like so:
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">7</span>
<span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Test&quot;</span>
<span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">1.3</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Test 2&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>If <code>&bull;</code> represents an arbitrary operation (such as <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, etc.,
					which we'll discuss more in the next section), then <code>a &bull;= b</code> is equivalent
					to <code>a = a &bull; b</code>. For example,
				</p>
				<div class="mac-terminal"><pre>
<span class="terminal-oneline">comp:py_data_vis user$ python3</span>
Python 3.7.3 (default, Mar 27 2019, 22:11:17)
[GCC 4.8.2] on mac
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; a += 6
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
11
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>since <code>a += 6</code> would expand out to <code>a = a + 6</code> &rArr; <code>a = 5 + 6</code> &rArr; <code>a =
					11</code>.
				</p>
				<h3 id="numbers">Numbers</h3>
				<p>As in most programming languages, there are two types of numbers: integers and
					floating point numbers. Integers are the the numbers {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} and
					their negatives and they convert directly into <a
					href="../../integer-representations-binary/index.html">Two's Complement
					Integers</a>. Unlike other languages, they don't have a fixed width, meaning you
					don't have to worry about integer overflow. Floating point numbers are built
					into the hardware, so they generally follow the IEEE-754 floating point
					precision format, specifically the <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">Double-Precision
					Floating-Point Format</a>. Floating point numbers are numbers written in
					scientific notation (1.23400 &times; 10<sup>3</sup>, but in base two. You have
					~16 decimal digits of precision and you can represent numbers from
					~10<sup>-308</sup> to 10<sup>308</sup>.
				</p>
				<p><b>If you would not describe something using scientific notation, you probably
					should use an integer</b>. To elaborate, if a value is discrete, like the number
					of elements in a list, the number of people in a store, or the amount of money
					you have (you can't have half a cent and you wouldn't say "I have $1.23400
					&times; 10<sup>3</sup> in my bank account), use an integer. If a value is
					continuous, like the amount of water you have in a bottle, the average height of
					all the people in a store, or the exchange rates between currencies, use a
					floating point number.
				</p>
				<p>You can make an integer by declaring a number without a decimal point and a
					floating point number by declaring a number with a decimal point, like so:
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="n">integer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="n">floating_point</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">1.</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>As you would expect, you can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and use
					parentheses to group numbers, but you can also take the remainder of a division,
					raise them to powers, and perform integer division (rounds to the integer
					closest to zero), like so
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="n">addition_example</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span>                <span class="c1"># 1 + 2         -&gt;   3</span>

				<p>If you want, you can experiment with this after this article to learn more. Try
					using the <code>python</code> interpreter (instructions are found in the section <a
					href="#experimenting">Experimenting</a> above) to answer the following
					questions (mouse over the rectangles below to see the solutions):
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Using the Pythagorean Theorem, calculate the length of the diagonal of a
						rectangle with a length of 9 units and a width of 40 units. In other words,
						rewrite the expression <img src="pythagorean.png"> in <code>python</code> code.
						<div class="spoiler">
							<div class="content">
							<div class="terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; (9 ** 2 + 40 ** 2) ** (1 / 2)
41.0
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
							</div>
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>If you were to buy 200 toys and divide them evenly between 14 schools, how many
						would each school have? How many would be left over?
						<div class="spoiler">
							<div class="content">
							<div class="mac-terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; toys_per_school = 200 // 14
&gt;&gt;&gt; toys_left_over = 200 % 14
&gt;&gt;&gt; toys_per_school
14
&gt;&gt;&gt; toys_left_over
4
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
							</div>
							<p>Note that we used integer division (<code>//</code>) because we wanted an integer number of
								toys and we wanted to round to zero.
							</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>Evaluate the expressions <code>10.5 / 1.25</code>, <code>10.5 // 1.25</code>, and <code>10.5 % 1.25</code>, and
						explain the reasons for their outputs.
						<div class="spoiler">
							<div class="content">
							<div class="terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 10.5 // 1.25
8.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; 10.5 % 1.25
0.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; 10.5 / 1.25
8.4
</pre>
							</div>
							<p><code>10.5 / 1.25</code> is exactly what you would get from just dividing the numbers,
								<code>10.5 // 1.25</code> rounds the result of <code>10.5 / 1.25</code> towards zero, and <code>10.5 %
								1.25</code> is <code>10.5 - (10.5 // 1.25) * 1.25</code>, or the remainder when you divide <code>10.5</code>
								by an integer multiple of <code>1.25</code>.
							</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
				<p><b>Lists</b> in python are modifiable ordered collections of objects of
					modifiable length. You can create a list using <code>[e0, e1, e2,...]</code>, and you
					access elements from that list using <code>a[i]</code>, where <code>a</code> is the list and <code>i</code> is
					the number of elements after the first element. You can treat <code>a[i]</code> just like a
					variable. For example,
				</p>
				<div class="mac-terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [ 1, 2, 3 ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0]
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1]
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0] = 7
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0]
7
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[ 7, 2, 3 ]
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>As you can see, we created a list with elements {1, 2, 3}, printed out the
					first two, and changed the first element using <code>a[0] = 7</code>. <span
					id="reversing-sequential-data">We can also go backwards through the list using
					<code>a[i]</code>, with <code>i</code> being negative</span>. The last element is <code>-1</code>, the second to
					last element is <code>-2</code>, etc. Lastly, we can take sections of a list (known as
					<b>list slicing</b>) using <code>a[start:stop:step]</code>, where <code>start</code> is the first
					element we want, <code>stop</code> is the element after the last element we want, and
					<code>step</code> is how many elements we want to go over. The easiest way to see this in
					action is to see a bunch of examples, so try to guess what the following
					statements will print out:
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[-1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0:3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[2:-1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[2:]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[::2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1::2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[::-1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1::-1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[-1:0:-1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[:0:-1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[-1:0:-2]
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>You can see what they actually print out by typing them into the <code>python</code>
					interpreter in the terminal, but <b>you should write out your guesses first so
					you can see exactly what you think these statements will do</b>. In doing so,
					you'll be able to seewhere you're making your mistakes in understanding this
					topic and then fix them. If you can't access a terminal but you want to
					continue, the answers are below. Mouse over them to see them.
				</p>
				<div class="spoiler">
					<div class="content">
					<div class="terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[-1]
6
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0:3]
[1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[2:-1]
[3, 4, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[2:]
[3, 4, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[::2]
[1, 3, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1::2]
[2, 4, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[::-1]
[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1::-1]
[2, 1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[-1:0:-1]
[6, 5, 4, 3, 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[:0:-1]
[6, 5, 4, 3, 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[-1:0:-2]
[6, 4, 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
					</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>You can concatenate lists using <code>list_a + list_b</code>. For example:
				</p>
				<div class="mac-terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [4, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a + b
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>Lists can also have duplicated elements, like so
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 1, 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0]
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1]
1
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>Since lists are objects, you can make a list of lists:
				</p>
				<div class="mac-terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [ [1, 2], [3, 4] ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0]
[1, 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0][1]
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1]
[3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1][0]
3
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>Lastly, since each element of a list is a variable, lists can hold different
					types of objects (though doing so likely means you should rethink your
					approach).
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; [1, 1.5, 'This is a string.']
[1, 1.5, 'This is a string.']
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
				</div>
				<h3 id="strings">Strings</h3>
				<p>Strings, as in most programming languages, represent text in <code>python</code>. Unlike
					other languages, there are four ways to declare a string in <code>python</code>:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>single quotes (<code>'Example'</code>):</b> Allow you to use double quotes inside a
						string without escaping them.
					</li>
					<li><b>double quotes (<code>"Example"</code>):</b> Allow you to use single quotes inside a
						string without escaping them.
					</li>
					<li><b>three single quotes (<code>'''Example'''</code>):</b> Allow you to use single quotes,
						double quotes, and newlines (what happens when you hit Enter/Return on your
						computer) without escaping them.
					</li>
					<li><b>three double quotes (<code>"""Example"""</code>):</b> Allow you to use single quotes,
						double quotes, and newlines (what happens when you hit Enter/Return on your
						computer) without escaping them.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>After you declare a string using one of these four ways, there is no difference
					between how you use them.
				</p>
				<p>Try typing the following phrases into the terminal to see what I mean:
				</p>
				<div class="mac-terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'example'
&gt;&gt;&gt; "example"
&gt;&gt;&gt; '''example'''
&gt;&gt;&gt; """example"""

&gt;&gt;&gt; 'There's an error here.'

				<p>The empty lines are just to divide the exercises into small chunks and the <code>...</code>
					will show up when you type a statement that goes onto the next line. For
					example, you should try (stop if you have an error) to type <code>'This statement</code>,
					hit Enter/Return twice, then type <code>will have an error.'</code>. Try to predict what
					will happen when you type these statements and then explain the results.
				</p>
				<p>As before, answers are below if you can't type it into your terminal.

				<p>First four:

'example'
&gt;&gt;&gt; '''example'''
'example'
&gt;&gt;&gt; """example"""
'example'
</pre>
					</div>
					<p>As you can see, all four produce the same output.
					</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>Next four:

					<p>The first string throws an error because it reaches a single quote, meaning it's
						reached the end of the string (since the string started with a single quote) and

						start and end and it stops reading the line when it hits an error.
					</p>
					<p>The third string throws an error because it reaches a double quote, meaning it's
						reached the end of the string (since the string started with a double quote) and
						it doesn't know what to do with everything after the second double quote. Like
						with the first string, it will read the text as <code>("He said, ")This</code> and stops

					<p>There's an error in the first three because the strings are terminated on the
						text before the next space immediately after the quote marks. The first two are
						explained in the last answer, but the third one happens because <code>""""</code> is split
						up like <code>""" "</code> instead of <code>" """</code>. You'll also notice that the last one prints
						out the quote mark in the string with a <code>\'</code> before it, which tells the
						interpreter that the quote mark should not be interpreted as ending the string.

					The <code>\n</code> is a special character that means go onto the next line and will not be
					displayed if you were to use the <code>print</code> function or you put one in a file.
					Instead, everything after the <code>\n</code> would move down a line. There are other
					special characters like <code>\t</code> for tab, but we won't go into them here.
				</p>
				<p>Once you've declared a string, you can access it just like a list, with slicing,
					accessing individual elements, etc. You cannot, however, modify a string in
					place.

&gt;&gt;&gt; a = "Test"
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0]
'T'
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0:2]

&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0] = 't'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>You can, however concatenate strings using <code>+</code> like you would a list:
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'a' + 'b'
'ab'
</pre>
				</div>
				<h3 id="tuples">Tuples</h3>
				<p>Tuples are immutable, ordered collections of data. They are denoted with
					parentheses around data:
				</p>
				<div class="mac-terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = ('Joseph', 20)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0]
'Joseph'
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1]
20
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1] + 1
21
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0] = 'Patrick'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>Tuples can also be concatenated like strings:
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; ('Joseph', [1, 2, 3], (1, 2)) + ('Jacob', 1, [1, 2])
('Joseph', [1, 2, 3], (1, 2), 'Jacob', 1, [1, 2])
</pre>
				</div>
				<h3 id="dictionaries">Dictionaries</h3>
				<p>Dictionaries are known by many names (associative arrays, hash tables, unordered
					maps, etc.), but they match a key to a value. For example, let's say we want to
					associate a person with his/her age. We could use the person's name as a key and
					their age as a value, like so:
				</p>
				<div class="mac-terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; people = { 'Joseph' : 20, 'Jacob' : 21, 'Patrick' : 20 }
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>We can access elements of <code>people</code> similar to how we accessed elements of a
					list, except that instead of using an index, we use the key, like so:
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; people['Joseph']
20
&gt;&gt;&gt; people['Patrick'] = 21
&gt;&gt;&gt; people
{'Joseph': 20, 'Jacob': 21, 'Patrick': 21}
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>As you can see above, we set the value corresponding to <code>'Patrick'</code> to be <code>21</code>,
					which we would need to do when he reaches his 21<sup>th</sup> birthday. To add
					elements to a dictionary, we can use the same syntax we used to change the value
					for the key <code>'Patrick'</code>, namely <code>dictionary[key] = value</code>. For example,
				</p>
				<div class="mac-terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; people['Jake'] = 46
&gt;&gt;&gt; people
{'Joseph': 20, 'Jacob': 21, 'Patrick': 21, 'Jake': 46}
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>Notice that the elements are in the order in which we added them and not any
					sorted order.
				</p>
				<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
				<p>Just to make sure we're on the same page, I'm going to ask a few questions about
					the properties and uses of various objects in python.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>How would you store the text <code>I don't really know what I want to do.</code>?
						<div class="spoiler">
							<div class="content">
							<p>Any of the following would work:
							</p>
							<div class="terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; string = "I don't really know what I want to do."
&gt;&gt;&gt; string = """I don't really know what I want to do."""
&gt;&gt;&gt; string = '''I don't really know what I want to do.'''
&gt;&gt;&gt; string = 'I don\'t really know what I want to do.'
</pre>
							</div>
							<p>Note that the last one escapes the single quote in <code>don't</code> so it can use single
								quotes to enclose the string.
							</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>How would you store the song lyrics exactly as shown below:<br>
						<code>Do you remember when<br>
						Things seemed so eternal?<br>
						Heroes were so real<br>
						Their magic frozen in time</code>
						<div class="spoiler">
							<div class="content">
							<div class="mac-terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; lyrics = """Do you remember when
... Things seemed so eternal?
... Heroes were so real
... Their magic frozen in time"""
&gt;&gt;&gt; lyrics = '''Do you remember when
... Things seemed so eternal?
... Heroes were so real
... Their magic frozen in time'''
&gt;&gt;&gt; lyrics = 'Do you remember when\nThings seemed so eternal?\nHeroes were so real\nTheir magic frozen in time'
&gt;&gt;&gt; lyrics = "Do you remember when\nThings seemed so eternal?\nHeroes were so real\nTheir magic frozen in time"
</pre>
							</div>
							<p>The first two use triple quotes to include the newlines, while the last two use
								the <code>\n</code> escape character.
							</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>List all the objects mentioned in this article and whether you can change them
						after you create them.
						<div class="spoiler">
							<div class="content">
							<ul>
								<li><b>Lists:</b> Yes
								</li>
								<li><b>Strings:</b> No
								</li>
								<li><b>Tuples:</b> No
								</li>
								<li><b>Dictionaries:</b> Yes
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Numbers are primitive to the point that there is no difference between changing
								them after you create them and replacing them with new ones.
							</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>Assume that you have a program that will read temperature over the course of an
						hour over equally spaced intervals and then graph the results. What object
						should you use to store this information and what object should you use to
						represent temperature?
						<div class="spoiler">
							<div class="content">
							<p>First, you should be using <b>floating point numbers</b> to represent
								temperature since temperature is continuous.  You should use a <b>list</b> to
								store all the information since you aren't working with text (which precludes
								strings) you need it to be ordered (which precludes dictionaries), and you need
								it to be mutable (which precludes tuples).
							</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>If the temperature were not read over equally spaced intervals, but instead read
						at random times, what object should you use to store each individual data point
						(time and temperature)? Assume that the time recorded is in milliseconds after
						starting the measurement.
						<div class="spoiler">
							<div class="content">
							<p>Either <b>two separate lists</b>, with one containing time of measurement and
								the other containing temperature, or a <b>list of tuples</b>, with each tuple
								containing a time and a temperature. It's trivial to convert from one to the
								other, so you should choose the one that works best with your interface.
							</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>What object would be best to store data for an event, assuming the event is
						defined by an event name, date, start time, end time, and place? Don't worry
						about the specific types of name, date, etc.
						<div class="spoiler">
							<div class="content">
							<p>Technically, you can use a list, dictionary, or a tuple, using an implicit
								ordering for the list and the tuple so that the first element is something like
								the name, the second element is the date, etc.
							</p>
							<div class="terminal"><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; event = [ 'Event Name', date, start, end, place ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; event = ( 'Event Name', date, start, end, place )
&gt;&gt;&gt; event = { 'Name' : 'Event Name',
... 'Date' : date,
... 'Start Time' : start,
... 'End Time' : end,
... 'Place' : place
... }
...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
							</div>
							<p>To me, I would probably use an extension of a tuple known as a <b>named
								tuple</b> or a <b>class</b>, which allows me to get the name using <code>event.name</code>,
								but we haven't covered them. With tuples, you have a nice regularity of your
								data that will allow you to easily map it to a database and back. Plus, it uses
								the least amount of memory to store data. With dictionaries, you can update the
								structure of your events (say by adding something like a notes section) without
								having to update all the events. Plus, it makes it easier to find relevant data
								by topic. I wouldn't use a list as you end up getting the worst of both worlds.
							</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>You are writing a program for a school that keeps track of students by a unique
						id number, their name, their grades, what year they'll graduate, and their
						majors. What would you use to store this information such that you can update
						and read information about a student given an id?
						<div class="spoiler">
							<div class="content">
							<p>If you are only going to read and modify data about a student given an id, then
								you should use a <b>dictionary, with the key being the id and the value being a
								tuple (preferably a named tuple) with all the other information.</b> It's
								important to note that as soon as you want something more complicated, such as
								printing out all the students with a 3.0 GPA or above, you'll probably want to
								switch to a database.
							</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>What object should you use to store words and the number of times each word
						shows up in some text?
						<div class="spoiler">
							<div class="content">
							<p>A <b>dictionary with the key for the word and the count as its value</b>.
