				<p><i>We're going to break this tutorial into several articles: one to set up a
					python program, a few to cover the features of python we'll use, and one to
					actually write the program. This article will focus on our general goal for the
					program and setting you up for python starting from scratch.</i>
				</p>
				<h2 id="an-unusual-pattern">An Unusual Pattern</h2>
				<p>Zipf's Law predicts that the n<sup>th</sup> most common item in a data set shows
					up 1/n times as often the most common item. For example, the second most common
					item should show up half as often as the most common item and the twentieth most
					common item should show up one twentieth as often as the most common element.
					This empirical law was originally derived from word counts, but it seems to
					apply to many other things like cities and their populations (the second most
					populous city has half as many people as the most populous people, etc.). In
					this tutorial, we're going to try to verify this law for a large body of text
					(specifically, <i>Moby Dick</i> because it's public domain and uses mostly ASCII
					characters).
				</p>
				<p>We're going to focus mainly on the python in this tutorial, so we won't go
					into Zipf's Law any more than we have to, but if you want to know more, you can
					check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">Wikipedia
					article on Zipf's Law</a> or the more entertaining <a
					href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCn8zs912OE">Vsauce video "The Zipf
					Mystery"</a>. We're also going to be using a modified, continuous version of the
					Zipf Distribution in this article, known as the <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution">Pareto Distribution</a>
					(a.k.a. the 80-20 Rule).
				</p>
				<h2 id="getting-started-with-python">Getting Started with Python</h2>
				<p>You will need:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>A text editor.
					</li>
					<li>A python interpreter which you can easily get using the Windows Subsytem for
						Linux or any POSIX (Linux, MacOS, etc.) terminal.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>You can also get started with python (though I wouldn't recommend it as a
					permanent solution) using <a href="repl.it">repl.it</a>. You don't need to
					create an account, but not doing so means you might not be able to access your
					programs later. Doing so means you would neither need a text editor nor a python
					interpreter, but you will need both in the future, so you might as well get them
					set up now.
				</p>
				<h2 id="how-to-read-the-terminals">How to Read the Terminals</h2>
				<p>Since this tutorial will focus on using the terminal for many reasons (most
					notably installing what you need to write programs in almost any language with
					any libraries just requires that you know the name of what you need and that
					using multiple programming languages together in one environment is trivial
					using the terminal), we are going to type stuff in the terminal.
				</p>
				<p>I will display the full terminal after you've typed in everything, including
					output. You should only type things that come after the dollar sign and on the
					same line. For example, if you were on Mac and you should type the phrase <code>mkdir
					-p example</code> and hit the Return key, then type the phrase <code>cd example</code> and hit
					the Return key, the terminal would look like
				</p>
				<div class="mac-terminal"><pre>
<span class="terminal-oneline">comp:~ user$ mkdir -p example</span>
<span class="terminal-oneline">comp:~ user$ cd example</span>
<span class="terminal-oneline">comp:example user$</span>
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>If it turns out to be a lot of output, then I'll say something like <code>A bunch of
					text output discussing ...</code> and I'll indent it. For example, if you're on Linux
					or the Windows Subsystem for Linux, I'll do something like
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre><span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">user@comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">~</span></b>$ sudo apt update</span>
[sudo] password for user:

    A bunch of text discussing update information

<span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">user@comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">~</span></b>$</span>
</pre>
				</div>
				<h3 id="text-editors">Text Editors</h3>
				<p>First, <b>you are going to need a <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor">text editor</a></b>. You will
					not be able to write python code without a text editor or an IDE that includes a
					text editor. Put simply, a text editor will take the characters you type and put
					them directly into a file. It will not add anything else but the characters. If
					you type the letters "abcd" into a file in a text editor and save it, the file
					will contain just those four characters (maybe some metadata about the file
					itself, too). <b>Microsoft Word (Windows), Google Docs (Browsers), Libre Office
					(Linux), Pages (Mac), etc. are not text editors</b>, as they save additional
					data about the text, such as the font, color, which text is bold, which text is
					italicized, whether you have formulas, etc. I will list several text editors
					along with a brief description. If you do not see a program on this list, it is
					probably not a text editor.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>GUI (Graphical) Text Editors
						<ul>
							<li><b>Visual Studio Code:</b> A small lightweight text editor that is closest to
								what you would expect from other products like Microsoft Word or Google Drive.
								It has the standard <b>File</b>, <b>Edit</b>, <b>View</b>, etc. at the top of
								the screen. Saving and creating files is just like in most other programs,
								though it also has other information, like directory structures, displayed on
								the screen.
							</li>
							<li><b>Sublime Text:</b> The same as Visual Studio Code with how you interact with
								it and what it can do for you. Eventually you might find that Visual Studio Code
								or Sublime Text has plugins or features that you would choose over the other,
								but not at this level.
							</li>
							<li><b>Notepad:</b> No syntax highlighting or any useful features at all, but it's
								already installed on most of your computers.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>IDEs (Includes text editors and other stuff)
						<ul>
							<li><b>Eclipse:</b> Slower than both Visual Studio Code and Sublime Text, but most
								students already have it to program in Java. Either way, it will work.
							</li>
							<li><b>Visual Studio Community Edition:</b> Slowest one to start up and it's
								supposed to be way more powerful than most other text editors, but I've never
								needed any of the more powerful features, so it just slowed down my computer.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Terminal Text Editors
						<ul>
							<li><b>vim:</b> A powerful, if slightly unintuitive text editor. It also has the
								nice benefit of being directly integrated into the terminal, so you can switch
								back and forth pretty quickly between writing code and running code.
							</li>
							<li><b>emacs:</b> Practically an operating system with a bad text editor (though it
								can be made better by using evil mode, which gives it vim keybindings).
							</li>
							<li><b>nano:</b> Slightly better version of Notepad in the terminal since it has
								syntax highlighting.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If you are totally new to programming, I would recommend using a GUI text editor
					so you don't have to learn two things at once. If you have Eclipse, go ahead and
					use it. If you don't like Eclipse, use Visual Studio Code.
				</p>
				<h4 id="installing-visual-studio-code">Installing Visual Studio Code</h4>
				<p>On MacOS, type
				</p>
				<div class="mac-terminal"><pre><span class="terminal-oneline">comp:~ user$ brew update</span>

				<p>On Linux, follow these instructions on <a

				</p>
				<p>On Windows, follow these instructions on <a
					href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows">installing Visual Studio
					Code on Windows</a>.
				</p>
				<h3 id="python-interpreter">Python Interpreter</h3>
				<p>If you're on Windows, get the <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/tutorial-install-linux-on-windows-wsl/">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>, which only requires you to download the
					Ubuntu app from the Windows store, turn on a setting (shown in the linked
					article), restart your computer, and enter a username and a password into the
					Ubuntu app and you're all set. <b>Remember this username and password, as you
					will need it later</b>. After this point, the rest of the tutorial will focus on
					using a Linux, MacOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux terminal. While the
					<code>python</code> code is independent of how you run it, there are certain operations
					that you need to do for every setup you have to make sure it runs properly, and
					I currently want to focus on the terminal.
				</p>
				<div class="aside" >
					<h4>Independent Python Interpreter</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>While there is an independent python interpreter for Windows, I would strongly
						recommend that you use the <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/tutorial-install-linux-on-windows-wsl/">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> because as soon as you want to do anything
						outside of <code>python</code>, you're stuck, especially if you want the programs to
						interact in any way.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>If you're on Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint (or any derived distro), or the Windows
					Subsystem for Linux, type the following into the terminal.
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre>
<span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">user@comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">~</span></b>$ sudo apt update</span>

    A bunch of text discussing installation information
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>The <code>-y</code> just answers "yes" to the prompt that comes up. If you're on another
					Linux distro, replace <code>sudo apt install</code> with whatever package manager you use
					for your distro.
				</p>
				<p>If you're on MacOS, use the command
				</p>
				<div class="mac-terminal"><pre>
<span class="terminal-oneline">comp:~ user$ brew install python python3 python-pip python3-pip</span>
</pre>
				</div>
				<p><b>Once you've sucessfully gotten to this point, you will not have to do any
					part of this process again as long as you don't uninstall anything.</b> You will
					have to do everything after this point for each project, but it's not nearly as
					much.
				</p>
				<h3 id="making-the-directory">Making the Directory</h3>
				<p>If you're on Windows, open up Ubuntu and type
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre>
<span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">user@comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">~</span></b>$ ln -s /mnt/c/Users/[user] win-home</span>

</pre>
				</div>
				<p>where <code>[user]</code> is your username on your Windows computer.
				</p>
				<p>If you're on Linux, open up the terminal and type
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre><span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">user@comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">~</span></b>$ mkdir -p dev/py_data_vis</span>

<span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">user@comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">~/dev/py_data_vis</span></b>$</span>
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>If you're on Mac, open up the terminal and type
				</p>
				<div class="mac-terminal"><pre><span class="terminal-oneline">comp:~ user$ mkdir -p dev/py_data_vis</span>
<span class="terminal-oneline">comp:~ user$ cd dev/py_data_vis</span>
<span class="terminal-oneline">comp:py_data_vis user$</span>
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>From this point onwards, you should remain in this directory and there should be
					no difference between operating systems. We have created an actual directory
					(a.k.a. a folder) on your system that you can access normally, through the file
					explorer. For Windows, this folder will be <code>C:\Users\[user]\dev\py_data_vis</code>.
				</p>
				<h3 id="creating-our-new-python-script">Creating Our New Python Script</h3>
				<p>In your text editor of choice, create a new file called <code>word_counter.py</code> and
					put it in the <code>py_data_vis</code> directory. This directory is <code>~/dev/py_data_vis</code> on
					Linux and Mac and it is <code>C:\Users\[user]\dev\py_data_vis</code> on Windows. If you're
					using a graphical text editor, click <b>File</b> in the top left corner and
					click <b>New File</b> (there may be shortcuts like Ctrl+N, but this method works
					for almost all graphical text editors). If it prompts you to give the file a
					name and a place to save it, set the name to <code>word_counter.py</code> and save it in
					the <code>py_data_vis</code> directory. If you're on Linux or Mac and you start out in a
					directory called <code>/</code> with folders like <code>bin</code>, <code>boot</code>, <code>dev</code>, <code>etc</code>, and <code>home</code>,
					move to <code>/home/[user]/dev/py_data_vis</code>, where <code>[user]</code> is your username.
				</p>
				<p>Visual Studio Code will prompt you for the name and where to save the file only
					after you save the file. I would suggest saving immediately and following the
					instructions in the previous paragraph.
				</p>
				<p>If you're using a terminal text editor, you can type the command <code>[editor]
					word_counter.py</code>, where <code>[editor]</code> is <code>vim</code>, <code>emacs</code>, or <code>nano</code>.
				</p>
				<p>On Linux, your terminal should look like
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre><span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">user@comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">~</span></b>$ sudo apt update</span>

				<h2 id="making-an-executable-python-script">Making an Executable Python Script</h2>
				<p>We'll have to tell the computer two things to make <code>word_counter.py</code> execute

				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>We have permission to execute the file.
					</li>
					<li>Use the <code>python3</code> interpreter to execute the file.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h4 id="changing-permissions">Changing Permissions</h4>
				<p>In your terminal, type
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre><span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">user@comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">~/dev/py_data_vis</span></b>$ ls -l word_counter.py</span>

<span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">user@comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">~/dev/py_data_vis</span></b>$ sudo chmod +x word_counter.py</span>

-rwxr-xr-x 1 user group     23 Mar  3 14:52 <span class="exe">word_counter.py</span>
</pre>
				</div>
				<p><code>ls -l word_counter.py</code> will list the <b>read/&#8203;write/&#8203;execute</b>
					permissions <code>for word_counter.py</code> along with the date of the last change to the
					file. The leftmost <code>-</code> means that the file is just a regular file (as opposed to
					a directory or other things). After that, every three characters refers to
					different classes of users: current user, current group, and everyone else. <code>r</code>
					refers to <b>read</b> permissions, <code>w</code> refers to <b>write</b> permissions, and
					<code>x</code> refers to <b>execute</b> permissions. You can therefore read the output of
					<code>ls -l word_counter.py</code> as
				</p>
				<p><blockquote>
					A normal file can be read and modified by <code>user</code>, read by users in the group
					<code>group</code>, and read by everyone else. It has <code>23</code> bytes. It was last modified on
					<code>March 3</code> at <code>14:52</code> (i.e. 2:52 PM) and the name of the file is
					<code>word_counter.py</code>.
					</blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>You'll see that there's a bit of a problem since we want to execute the program
					but no one has permission to execute the program. We can change this with the
					<code>chmod</code> command. Since we'll have to run it as an admin (a.k.a. root on Linux
					and MacOS), we'll put <code>sudo</code> in front of the command, which stands for "<code>s</code>uper
					<code>u</code>ser <code>do</code>". We add the option <code>+x</code> to <code>add</code> e<code>x</code>ecute permissions for everyone
					(you can do it for individual users but it won't matter here). Lastly, we want
					to change the permissions for the file <code>word_counter.py</code>, so we'll need to add
					that into the command, meaning we have to type <code>sudo chmod +x word_counter.py</code>.
				</p>
				<p>You'll see the password prompt pop up for your password. On the Windows
					Susbsytem for Linux, type in the password that you first typed into the
					terminal. On Linux or Mac, type in the same password you use to log into your
					computer. Do not be worried if nothing shows up when you type &mdash; it's a
					security measure to prevent people from seeing any information about your
					password. Hit Enter/Return to confirm your password.
				</p>
				<p>After running <code>ls -l word_counter.py</code> again, you'll see that the script now has
					a bunch of <code>x</code>'s, meaning anyone can execute it.
				</p>
				<h4 id="telling-the-computer-to-use-python3-to-execute-word_8203counter8203py">Telling the Computer to Use <code>python3</code> to Execute <code>word_&#8203;counter&#8203;.py</code></h4>

				<p>This line of code is a <b>comment</b> in <code>python</code> since comments start with a

					and look for a <code>#!</code> (known as a <b>shebang</b>), which tells the terminal to use
					the <code>python3</code> interpreter when executing this file.
				</p>
				<h4 id="obligatory-hello-world">Obligatory <code>Hello, World!</code></h4>
				<p>Since your first program that does anything must print <code>Hello, World!</code> by tradition,

					going to remove it immediately afterwards since we don't need it. In <code>python</code>,
					we just need to type <code>print("Hello, World")</code> in <code>word_counter.py</code>, so our file
					should now look like
				</p>
				<div class="code-blocktable">
<table><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!/usr/bin/env python3</span>

<span class="hll"><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></pre></div>
</td></tr></table>				
				</div>
				<p>Save this file and run it from the terminal using <code>./word_counter.py</code>, which
					should look like
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre>
<span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">user@comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">~/dev/py_data_vis</span></b>$ ./word_counter.py</span>
Hello, World!
<span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">user@comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">~/dev/py_data_vis</span></b>$</span>
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>Then, remove the <code>Hello, World!</code> line and save the file again.
				</p>
				<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
				<p>Now that we have an executable <code>python</code> script, we could start writing some
					<code>python</code> code. First, I would like to devote an article to <a
					href="../2/">covering the features of <code>python</code> we'll use</a> in this program
					since these features are independent of this specific program and you can use
					them in any <code>python</code> program.
