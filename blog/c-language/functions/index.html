				<p><i>This in the tenth article in the </i>Making Sense of C<i> series.
					In this article, we're going to come up with ways to group together statements
					in code to make it possible to reuse code without copying it, which will improve
					the legibility of our code and reduce the spread of bugs.</i>
				</p>
				<p>So far, we've
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>determined that we're going to give the compiler a file with a bunch of
						statements ending in semicolons,
					</li>
					<li>established that we can use comments with <code>//</code> for single line comments and <code>/*</code>
						and <code>*/</code> for multiline comments,
					</li>
					<li>reserved the symbols <code>+-*/%</code> for arithmetic,
					</li>
					<li>set up variables <code>[type] [variable] = [expression]</code> which will allow us to store
						values for later use,
					</li>
					<li>come up with the integral types (<code>char</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>int</code>, and <code>long long</code>) and
						the floating point types (<code>float</code> and <code>double</code>),
					</li>
					<li>figured out a way to represent characters using the <code>char</code> type and invented the
						<code>'\0'</code> character, which indicates that we're ending a string,
					</li>
					<li>decided to use single quotes around a character to represent the ASCII value for
						that <code>char</code>,
					</li>
					<li>explained how the program uses memory addresses to identify variables,
					</li>
					<li>came up with a way to access the memory address of a variable using the <b>
						address of</b> operator (<code>&amp;</code>),
					</li>
					<li>came up with a way to access the value stored at a memory address using the
						<b>dereference</b> operator (<code>*</code>),
					</li>
					<li>created <b>pointer</b> variables to allow us to store memory addresses using the
						syntax <code>type * variable_name;</code>,
					</li>
					<li>came up with a way to tell the computer to get us a block of memory (a.k.a. an
						<b>array</b> or <b>buffer</b>) using the syntax <code>type
						array[num_elements];</code>,
					</li>
					<li>came up with a way to initialize an array with an <b>initializer list</b>,
					</li>
					<li>came up with a way to initialize a <code>char</code> array using double quotes
						(<code>"Hello!"</code>),
					</li>
					<li>came up with a way to access elements of an array using the syntax
						<code>variable_name[offset]</code>,
					</li>
					<li>added the ability to use conditional branches through <code>if else</code> statements,
					</li>
					<li>and added the ability to use loop through something with <code>for</code> and <code>while</code>.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In the last article, we established control flow, which is the collective term
					for conditional branches and loops.
				</p>
				<div class="aside" >
					<p>Technically, functions are also included in control flow, but I didn't include
						them in the control flow article because you could replace the function with the
						code in the function and get the same exact result.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>We also used control flow to come up with some code that can do different things
					depending on whether two strings match:
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">str1</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">str2</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">str1</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">str2</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">str1</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">str2</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Do stuff you would want to do if the two strings match</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Do stuff you would want to do if the two strings don&#39;t match</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>We'll modify it in this article, but not significantly.
				</p>
				<p>With just what we have up to this point, we have enough functionality in the
					language to make any program, but doing so would be tedious for several reasons,
					most notably the lack of functions and the lack of a standard library.
					In this article, we're going to add functions to <code>C</code>.
				</p>
				<h2 id="what-is-a-function">What is a Function?</h2>
				<p>A function in mathematics takes in an input and produces an output, with the
					rule that the same exact input produces the same exact output.
					Functions in <code>C</code> work just like functions in math, though the input and output
					are slightly more complicated.
					To the computer, a function is a set of instructions that the computer will jump
					to, execute, and jump back from.
				</p>
				<h2 id="function-syntax">Function Syntax</h2>
				<p>Since we used the general syntax
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="n">keyword</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">code</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">execute</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>for the other elements of control flow, let's keep it with modifications.
					We know that we're going to put the code to execute between the curly braces,
					but functions also have inputs and an output.
					Like with <code>if</code> statements, <code>for</code> loops, and <code>while</code> loops, we put the input
					between the parentheses but we need somewhere to put the output.
					We also need to know the types of everything and we need to be able to provide
					multiple inputs.
					Inside the function, we'll need to tell the computer what we want to return from
					the function, so we'll use the keyword <code>return</code> with the syntax <code>return
					output;</code>.
					Finally, when we want to execute the function, we just need to specify the name
					and the inputs.
				</p>
				<p>The syntax for calling a function is
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="n">function_name</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">first_input</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">second_input</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>If we want to store the output, we can use
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="n">variable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">function_name</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>The syntax for declaring a function with one input is
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="n">output_type</span> <span class="nf">function_name</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">type</span> <span class="n">input</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">first</span> <span class="n">statement</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">second</span> <span class="n">statement</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="c1">// and so on</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">output</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>The syntax for declaring a function with two inputs is
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="n">output_type</span> <span class="nf">function_name</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">first_type</span> <span class="n">first_input</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">second_type</span> <span class="n">second_input</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">first</span> <span class="n">statement</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">second</span> <span class="n">statement</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="c1">// and so on</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">output</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>I'll let you guess the syntax for three inputs.
				</p>
				<p>We can also have functions that take in no input using the syntax:
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="n">output_type</span> <span class="nf">function_name</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">first</span> <span class="n">statement</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">second</span> <span class="n">statement</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="c1">// and so on</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">output</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>We can have functions that return no output by making the output type <code>void</code>:
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">function_name</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">first</span> <span class="n">statement</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">second</span> <span class="n">statement</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="c1">// and so on</span>
    <span class="k">return</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<div class="aside" >
					<h5>The <code>void</code> Type</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>The <code>void</code> type is different from all other types because you cannot make a
						variable of <code>void</code> type and you cannot use a <code>void</code> type in any of the
						operations we've established.
						It might seem pointless, but it has a few specific usages.
						Returning nothing from a function and telling the compiler that the function
						doesn't take inputs are two uses.
						Later, we'll cover the other main use of <code>void</code>.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>As you would guess we can use the inputs to our function in our function.
					Inputs and the output can be any of the types we've established up to this
					point, including pointer types such as <code>char *</code> and <code>int *</code>.
				</p>
				<h2 id="return-statements-exit-the-function-immediately"><code>return</code> Statements Exit the Function Immediately</h2>
				<p>I want to emphasize that your function will exit as soon as it hits a <code>return</code>
					statement.
					For example:
				</p>

				<p>If the value of <code>number</code> is greater than <code>12200160415121876738</code>, then the
					function will immediately exit with output <code>0</code> without even looking at the other
					code, otherwise, it will calculate the smallest Fibonacci number above the
					number you give the function.
				</p>
				<p>By the way, here's the code without comments so it's easier to read:
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">unsigned</span> <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="nf">smallest_fibonacci_above</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">unsigned</span> <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="n">number</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="kt">unsigned</span> <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="n">previous</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">current</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">previous</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">current</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">current</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">number</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">current</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<h2 id="pass-by-value">Pass by Value</h2>
				<p>Lastly, I want to make sure that it's clear that when you call a function, you
					create copies of the inputs and store them into whatever variables you use for
					the parameter.
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">unsigned</span> <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="n">example</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kt">unsigned</span> <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">smallest_fibonacci_above</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>Notice that I passed in <code>example</code> to the function even though the function
					definition uses <code>number</code> as the parameter, and the variables will refer to
					different memory.
					The value in <code>example</code> will be copied into <code>number</code>, meaning that if you had a
					function like
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">change_value_to_four</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">number</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">return</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>and you use it like so
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">random_number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">73</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">change_value_to_four</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">random_number</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p><code>random_number</code> is still <code>73</code>, because <code>random_number</code> is copied into <code>number</code>,
					and, just as modifying a copy of something doesn't affect the original, neither
					does modifying <code>number</code>.
					You should have two questions:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Why does <code>C</code> copy the input into a variable?
					</li>
					<li>How can I give a function some data and have it modify the data?
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We can answer both of them easily.
				</p>
				<h3 id="why-does-c-copy-input-into-variables">Why Does <code>C</code> Copy Input into Variables?</h3>
				<p>I can actually show you with one line:
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="n">change_value_to_four</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">73</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>Remember that plain numbers are <b>rvalues</b>, which means they neither have a
					memory address nor can they be assigned values.
					If <code>C</code> didn't copy <code>73</code> into a variable, this program would make no sense
					because we can't store things without somewhere to store it.
				</p>
				<h3 id="modifying-data-passed-into-functions">Modifying Data Passed Into Functions</h3>
				<p>Functions will always copy their inputs into their own local variables, so we
					can't pass the value as is.
					In other words, if we want to pass in an <code>int</code> to a function that we can modify,
					we cannot have it come in as a parameter as an <code>int</code> like so
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">example_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">input</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// input is a copy of whatever you passed in, so you can&#39;t modify it</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>You're going to need to modify the <code>int input</code> section of the code.
					If you look through everything we've come up with so far in <code>C</code>, you should be
					able to figure out some way we can tell the computer <b>what memory we want to
					modify</b>.
					For now, I'm going to leave this as an exercise for you to figure out on your
					own.
					I'll cover it in the future, but just go through all the features we've covered
					up to this point and figure out which feature can help us.
					For example, comments cannot help us because the compiler will ignore them and
					arithmetic operations cannot help us because any arithmetic we do within the
					function will be done on the local copy, not the original data.
				</p>
				<h2 id="functions-in-our-programs">Functions in Our Programs</h2>
				<p>For us, we'll need functions to:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>check if two words match,
					</li>
					<li>read a file word by word,
					</li>
					<li>print the output,
					</li>
					<li>get the word the user wants to be counted,
					</li>
					<li>and get the filename from the user.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Since reading from a file is dependent on your file system and printing output
					is dependent on your terminal/console/command prompt, you as a programmer
					shouldn't have to write these functions for yourself, so we'll include them in
					the standard library, which we'll discuss more in the next few articles.
				</p>
				<p>Checking if two words match is common enough that the standard library also has
					some functions to handle it for you, but since almost all computers use the same
					character encodings, we can actually write the function ourselves.
					Of course, the authors of the standard library are going to write
					platform-specific code that takes advantage of how the computer works at a low
					level for each platform, CPU architecture, etc., so we probably shouldn't use
					our code for checking if strings match in code that we're going to publish.
					We'll write the function ourselves just to get some practice working with
					functions.
				</p>
				<p>In our case, we'll convert our code to check if two words are the same into a
					function.
				</p>
				<p>We'll need the two strings as input and a name for the function.
					Since we're checking if two strings match/differ, let's call it
					<code>check_if_strings_differ</code>.
					We could have also done <code>check_if_strings_match</code>, but <code>check_if_strings_differ</code>
					is more consistent with how the standard library works, so we won't have to
					change our code in the future once we replace our function with the standard
					library.
				</p>
				<p>We'll also need to figure out what exactly we want the function to do so we can
					figure out exactly what code we should write for the function.
					In our case, we want to follow the Single Responsibility Principle, which states
					that everything in your code should do one and only one thing.

					<h5>Single Responsibility Principle</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>To understand why the Single Responsibility Principle is so important, imagine
						if you had to go to the store whenever you pick up your children because you
						had to buy groceries and pick up your children once in the same day.
						Such a situation never happens in real life because we treat these as separate
						tasks, but novice programmers often combine tasks into one giant task
						unnecessarily because they don't follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
					</p>
					<p>As an example, let's say you're writing a program that has a screen that allows
						users to log in at some point in the program.
						You'll need to display a screen that shows a box for a username and a box for
						the password and you'll need to check if the password given matches the username
						given.
						You should probably not have a singular function that checks if the username and
						password match and displays what the user sees because now if you need to change
						either the code for logging in or the code for displaying what the user sees,
						you will need to waste time figuring out which lines of code are relevant to
						what you want to do.
						Furthermore, changing the login checking shouldn't change what the user sees
						after attempting to log in and changing what the user sees after logging in
						shouldn't change the login process, but by putting them in the same function,
						you're coupling them together.
					</p>
					<p>They should be two separate functions passing relevant information back and
						forth between each other.
						To check if a username and password match, all you need is the username, the
						password, and some way of checking if they match.
						You do not need to know where the username and password input boxes are on the
						screen, the color of the background, etc.
						Likewise, the function to display the screen doesn't need to know anything about
						how to determine whether the username and password match, just whether or not
						the username and password match.
					</p>
					<p>To be clear, there might be some security things you need to take into account
						that would make you write a program differently, but you would still follow the
						Single Responsibility Principle.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>For example, we'll want to check if two strings match and do different things
					depending on whether they match or not.
					We have four responsibilities:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>figuring out whether the strings match,
					</li>
					<li>doing something if the strings match,
					</li>
					<li>doing something else if the strings don't match,
					</li>
					<li>and making sure that the other three responsibilities have everything they need.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The last responsibility is a little bit harder to explain, but it's the easiest
					to code: it's the <code>if</code> statement that takes the output for responsibility 1 and
					decides what to do based on the output.
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// Responsibility 4</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">check_if_strings_differ</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">word1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">word2</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Responsibility 3</span>
    <span class="c1">// Do stuff you would want to do if the words differ</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Responsibility 2</span>
    <span class="c1">// Do stuff you would want to do if the words match</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>And <code>check_if_strings_differ</code> will take care of responsibility 1.
					So now, we've decided that <code>check_if_strings_differ</code> will return <code>0</code> if the
					strings don't match and <code>1</code> if the strings do match.
					If we kept our version with the <code>if</code> statement at the end, we would be combining
					responsibilities 1 and 4, which leads to code that's harder to maintain.
				</p>
				<p>Anyway, we'll keep our original code but output <code>str1[i] != str2[i]</code> instead of
					using the <code>if</code> statement.
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// Responsibility 1</span>

</pre></div>
				
				<p>We've written our first function!
				</p>
				<div class="aside" >
					<h5><code>if (condition_is_true) { return true; } else { return false; }</code></h5>
					<hr>
					<p>Generally, when people first learn a programming language and they want to
						return a true or false value from a function, they write code like
					</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
					
					<p>which is valid, but verbose because <b>what you want to return and the result of <code>a
						== b</code> are identical</b>.
						You could just as easily write the code as
					</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
					
					<p>The title of this aside is how you would read the novice code with the <code>if</code>
						statement, which should make it clear why you can just use the <code>return</code>
						statement.
					</p>

				<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
				<p>In this article, we set up the basic syntax for functions in <code>C</code>, we introduced
					the <code>void</code> type and two ways to use it, and we introduced a way to call
					functions.
					We also wrote our own function to check if two strings differ.
				</p>
				<h2 id="whats-next">What's Next</h2>
				<p>We're almost to the point where we can write our first program!
					Furthermore, because of the way we've written these articles, once we can write
					a complete program, we'll be able to write other programs quickly and easily.
				</p>
				<p>We just need to know how to
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>establish some form of an entry point,
					</li>
					<li>set up and use a compiler,
					</li>
					<li>print something out to the terminal,
					</li>
					<li>and read from a file.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Remember that we can write functions that can be executed at any time, but we
					need some way to tell the program which function to run first, i.e. establish
					some form of an entry point.
					We also need some way of getting user input from the command line (later, we
					will likely cover different graphical user interfaces).
					In the next article, <a href="../main-function/">The main Function
					in C</a>, we'll discuss the <code>main</code> function in <code>C</code> and how we can use it to take
					in user input.
