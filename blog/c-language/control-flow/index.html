				<hr style="border: 3px solid black;">
				<p><i>This is the ninth article in the </i>Making Sense of C<i> series.
					In this article, we're going to come up with ways to modify the behavior of the
					program at runtime.</i>
				</p>
				<p>So far, we've
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>determined that we're going to give the compiler a file with a bunch of
						statements ending in semicolons,
					</li>
					<li>established that we can use comments with <code>//</code> for single line comments and <code>/*</code>
						and <code>*/</code> for multiline comments,
					</li>
					<li>reserved the symbols <code>+-*/%</code> for arithmetic,
					</li>
					<li>set up variables <code>[type] [variable] = [expression]</code> which will allow us to store
						values for later use,
					</li>
					<li>come up with the integral types (<code>char</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>int</code>, and <code>long long</code>) and
						the floating point types (<code>float</code> and <code>double</code>),
					</li>
					<li>figured out a way to represent characters using the <code>char</code> type and invented the
						<code>NULL</code> character, which indicates that we're ending a string,
					</li>
					<li>and decided to use single quotes around a character to represent the ASCII value
						for that <code>char</code>.
					</li>
					<li>explained how the program uses memory addresses to identify variables,
					</li>
					<li>came up with a way to access the memory address of a variable using the <b>
						address of</b> operator (<code>&amp;</code>),
					</li>
					<li>came up with a way to access the value stored at a memory address using the
						<b>dereference</b> operator (<code>*</code>),
					</li>
					<li>created <b>pointer</b> variables to allow us to store memory addresses using the
						syntax <code>type * variable_name;</code>,
					</li>
					<li>came up with a way to tell the computer to get us a block of memory (a.k.a. an
						<b>array</b> or <b>buffer</b>) using the syntax <code>type
						array[num_elements];</code>,
					</li>
					<li>came up with a way to initialize an array with an <b>initializer list</b>,
					</li>
					<li>came up with a way to initialize a <code>char</code> array using double quotes
						(<code>"Hello!"</code>),
					</li>
					<li>and came up with a way to access elements of an array using the syntax
						<code>variable_name[offset]</code>.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Once we get to the projects and we have some actual example code, I'll stop
					listing everything we've covered up to this point.
					For now, I think it's important to keep all these ideas in your working memory
					so that once we get to the projects, you won't have to go back to the earlier
					articles and forget everything up to this point.
				</p>
				<p>In the last article, we ended by saying that we need some way to tell if two
					strings have the same characters, which means we'll need the ability to do two
					things:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Loop through all the characters in a word until we reach the end.
					</li>
					<li>Add one to the total if the words match.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In this article, we're going to introduce these methods.
				</p>
				<h2 id="topics-covered">Topics Covered</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Relational Operators:</b> <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>
					</li>
					<li><b>Logical Operators:</b> <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, and <code>!</code>
					</li>
					<li><b>Conditional Branches:</b> <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>
					</li>
					<li><b>Unindexed Looping:</b> <code>while</code> and <code>do</code>
					</li>
					<li><b>Indexed Looping:</b> <code>for</code>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 id="relational-operators">Relational Operators</h2>
				<p>First, we're going to need some sort of way to evaluate whether or not a
					statement is true, so we're going to introduce a few operators to help us out.
					In a natural language (e.g. English), you can read these operators as
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><code>==</code>:<span style="padding-left: 1em;">equals</span>
					</li>
					<li><code>!=</code>:<span style="padding-left: 1em;">does not equal</span>
					</li>
					<li><code>&lt;</code>:<span style="padding-left: 1.56em;">less than</span>
					</li>
					<li><code>&lt;=</code>:<span style="padding-left: 1em;">less than or equal to</span>
					</li>
					<li><code>&gt;</code>:<span style="padding-left: 1.56em;">greater than</span>
					</li>
					<li><code>&gt;=</code>:<span style="padding-left: 1em;">greater than or equal to</span>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>and they all use the syntax <code>[expression 1] &#9634; [expression 2]</code>, where
					<code>&#9634;</code> represents any of the relational operators.
					<code>a &#9634; b</code> returns <code>1</code> if <code>a &#9634; b</code> and <code>0</code> otherwise.
				</p>
				<p>For example:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><code>5 == 5</code>&rArr;<code>1</code> because "<code>5</code> equals <code>5</code>" is a true statement
					</li>
					<li><code>5 == 6</code>&rArr;<code>0</code> because "<code>5</code> equals <code>6</code>" is a false statement
					</li>
					<li><code>5 != 5</code>&rArr;<code>0</code> because "<code>5</code> does not equal <code>5</code>" is a false statement
					</li>
					<li><code>5 != 6</code>&rArr;<code>1</code> because "<code>5</code> does not equal <code>6</code>" is a true statement
					</li>
					<li><code>25 == 6 * 4 + 1</code>&rArr;<code>1</code> because the right side of the <code>==</code> evaluates to 25
						and "<code>25</code> equals <code>25</code>" is a true statement.
					</li>
					<li><code>8 &lt;= 100</code>&rArr;<code>1</code> because "<code>8</code> is less than or equal to <code>100</code>" is a true
						statement
					</li>
					<li><code>8 &lt;= 8</code>&rArr;<code>1</code> because "<code>8</code> is less than or equal to <code>8</code>" is a true
						statement
					</li>
					<li><code>8 &lt; 8</code>&rArr;<code>0</code> because "<code>8</code> is less than <code>8</code>" is a false statement
					</li>
					<li><code>8 &lt;= -7</code>&rArr;<code>0</code> because "<code>8</code> is less than or equal to <code>-7</code>" is a false
						statement
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I could keep going, but the general idea remains the same.
				</p>
				<h2 id="logical-operators">Logical Operators</h2>
				<p>What if you want to check two things?
					For example, what if you want to check if a number is between <code>4</code> and <code>20</code>?
				</p>
				<p>You can use the <b>logical operators</b> to check for multiple conditions.
					These operators represent the fundamental operators of boolean logic.
					Both <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> have the syntax <code>[expression 1] &#9634; [expression 1]</code>,
					but <code>!</code> has the syntax <code>![expression]</code>.
					All logical operators return <code>1</code> or <code>0</code> just like the relational operators.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><code>&amp;&amp;</code> represents <code>and</code>, which will return <code>1</code> <b>if both the expressions to
						the left and right of <code>&amp;&amp;</code> are not zero</b>.
					</li>
					<li><code>||</code> represents <code>or</code>, which will return <code>1</code> <b>if either of the expressions to
						the left and right of <code>||</code> is not zero</b>.
					</li>
					<li><code>!</code> represents <code>not</code>, which will return <code>1</code> only <b>if the expression to its
						right is zero</b>.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Usually, you would use the logical operators with the relational operators.
					For example, say you want a username to be between <code>4</code> and <code>20</code> characters long.
					Assuming you have the length of the username stored in a variable called
					<code>username_len</code>, you could check if it was more than four characters using <code>4
					&lt; username_len</code> and you could check if it was less than <code>20</code> characters
					long using <code>20 &gt; username_len</code>.
					To check if the username is both longer than four characters <b>and</b> less
					than twenty charachters, you would use the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator like <code>(4 &lt;
					username_len) &amp;&amp; (20 &gt; username_len)</code>.
				</p>
				<h2 id="conditional-branches">Conditional Branches</h2>
				<p>In <code>C</code>, <code>0</code> is interpreted as false and everything else is interpreted as true.
					<code>C</code> does not have dedicated boolean types built into the langauge, but all
					conditional branches and loops work under <code>0</code>&rArr;<code>false</code>.
					The logical and relational operators are mainly used with conditional branches
					and loops.
				</p>
				<p>For example, let's go back to the username example in the Logical Operators
					section, where we figured out an expression that would help us get a username
					that was more than four characters and less than twenty.
					We'll go through three cases.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>We want to do stuff if the username is the right length.
					</li>
					<li>We want to do stuff if the username is the right length <b>and different stuff
						otherwise</b>.
					</li>
					<li>we want to tell the user that the username is too short if the username is too
						short, tell the user that the username is too long if the username is too long,
						and do valid username stuff if the username is the right length.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h3 id="if-and-else"><code>if</code> and <code>else</code></h3>
				<p>Since we need to come up with some keyword or symbol or something to tell the
					computer to do one thing if a condition is true and do something else if a
					condition is false.
					Well, since we used <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> in describing what we want the computer to
					do and since they're short keywords, let's just use <code>if</code> to indicate that we
					want to do something and <code>else</code> to indicate that we want to do something else.
				</p>
				<h3 id="organizing-code-in-a-conditional-branch">Organizing Code in a Conditional Branch</h3>
				<p>A conditional branch has five parts:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the <code>if</code> keyword,
					</li>
					<li>the condition you want to test,
					</li>
					<li>the code you want to execute if the <code>if</code> statement is true,
					</li>
					<li>an optional <code>else</code> keyword,
					</li>
					<li>and the code you want to execute if the <code>if</code> statement is false.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We also need some way of separating these parts from the rest of the code.
					The grouping symbols we have are <code>(){}[]</code>.
					Since we already use <code>[]</code> for arrays, we can only use <code>(){}</code>.
					We'll put the condition we want to test in <code>()</code> and the code we want to execute
					in <code>{}</code>.
					If we have an <code>else</code> statement, we can put it after the code we want to execute.
				</p>
				<p>Our generic conditional branch will look like:
				</p>

				<h3 id="putting-it-together">Putting it Together</h3>
				<p>Here is how we would apply <code>if</code> statements to deal with the three cases to check
					the username.
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// FIRST CASE: WE ONLY WANT TO DO STUFF IF THE USERNAME IS VALID</span>

				<p>The third case is closest to something you would see in actual code, though the

				<p>Just to be absolutely clear on what the computer will do when it sees this code,
					I'm going to list out all the steps the computer will take when it enters the
					<code>if</code> statement.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Evaluate <code>4 &gt; username_len</code>.
					</li>
					<li>If <code>4 &gt; username_len</code> is true, then go to step 3, else go to step 5.
					</li>
					<li>Execute whatever is in the set of curly brackets after the <code>if (4 &gt;
						username_len)</code>.
					</li>
					<li>Go to step 10.
					</li>
					<li>Evaluate <code>20 &lt; username_len</code>.
					</li>
					<li>If <code>20 &lt; username_len</code> is true, then go step 6, else go to step 8.

					<h5>Using <code>==</code> Instead of <code>=</code></h5>
					<hr>
					<p>In general, you should not put variables on the left of the <code>==</code> operator
						because it's common to accidentally type <code>=</code> instead, which leads to valid <code>C</code>
						code <b>that acts differently from what you expected</b>, which is what causes
						most bugs and security exploits.
						If you want to test if a variable equals an expression, <code>[variable] ==
						[expression]</code> will return a <code>1</code> if <code>[variable]</code> equals <code>[expression]</code> and a <code>0</code>
						if <code>[variable]</code> does not equal <code>[expression]</code>.
					</p>
					<p>On the other hand, <code>[variable] = [expression]</code> will return <code>[expression]</code>.
						Since only <code>0</code> is considered false, what you're actually testing is
						<code>[expression] != 0</code>.
					</p>
					<p>If you do <code>[expression] == [variable]</code>, however, it functions exactly like
						<code>[variable] == [expression]</code>, but now if you forget the second <code>=</code>, the compiler
						will catch the error because you cannot assign an expression to another
						expression.
					</p>
					<p>In code it would look like:
					</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// This is what the typo would look like. a = 5 will always return 5, which will</span>
<span class="c1">// always be interpreted as true, so the stuff inside the if statement will</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

					<p>In general, you should try to code in such a way that if you make a mistake, the

				<h2 id="using-a-simple-if-in-our-code">Using a Simple <code>if</code> in Our Code</h2>
				<p>Now that we have a way for us to check if some condition is true, we can check

				<p>Of course, this code has a ton of problems:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If a user wants to use a different word, he or she will have to rewrite the
						source code.
						You might recognize rewriting the source code of a program to change how it
						behaves as something you would never think of doing.
						At worst, you should be changing config files.
					</li>
					<li>It doesn't check for capital and lowercase letters (which is its own problem
						that we'll deal with in a later article).
					</li>
					<li>It only works if <code>word</code> has at least four characters.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We should be able to handle pretty much any word of any length without writing
					the word directly in the source code.
					In this case, we will have to introduce a loop.
				</p>
				<h2 id="loops">Loops</h2>
				<p>Loops are pretty straightforward.
					While some condition is true, it will run through the code in the block, jump
					back to the top of the block, and then keep executing the code in the block
					again.
					We have two types of looping: unindexed and indexed.
					To check if two strings match, we need to check if each individual character
					matches including the null character (<code>'\0'</code>) and we should stop once we see the
					null character.
					Since we don't know how long the string will be beforehand, we should use
					unindexed looping.
				</p>
				<h3 id="unindexed-looping">Unindexed Looping</h3>
				<p>There are two types of unindexed loops: <code>while</code> loops and <code>do-while</code> loops.
					A while loop is the simplest, and it has a similar syntax to an <code>if</code> statement.
				</p>

</pre></div>
				
				<p>While <code>condition</code> is true, the loop will execute all the code inside the curly
					braces, then jump back to the top of the curly braces, check the condition, then
					repeat until <code>condition</code> is false.
				</p>
				<p>For example, let's go back to the <code>username_len</code> example.
					We never specified how we would calculate it because we didn't have the tools to
					calculate it properly.
					Now that we have a <code>while</code> loop, we can using this code (assume that the
					username is stored in the variable <code>username</code> and that <code>username</code> is a <code>char</code>

				<p>A few things to note here:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I set <code>username_len</code> to <code>0</code> before I started.
					</li>
					<li><code>username[username_len]</code> returns the character at <code>(username + username_len)</code>.
					</li>
					<li><code>username[username_len]</code> keeps changing because we keep changing the value of
						<code>username_len</code>.
					</li>
					<li><code>username[username_len]</code> is the condition, and it works because <code>0</code> is false in
						<code>C</code> and the null terminator is actually <code>0</code> in ASCII.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Let's say for a moment that our username is <code>"jpm"</code>.
					The value in <code>username</code> is <code>{ 'j', 'p', 'm', '\0' } </code>.

				<p>If you're wondering why we used a <code>while</code> loop instead of a <code>do-while</code> loop for
					finding out the length of the username even though they produces similar

					is checked, <code>username_len</code> will always be greater than <code>1</code>, even if you pass in
					the empty string <code>""</code>, which should have a <code>username_len</code> of <code>0</code>.
				</p>
				<h3 id="indexed-looping">Indexed Looping</h3>
				<p>Since we're covering control flow in this article, we should cover the other
					type of looping in <code>C</code>: <code>for</code> loops.
					We'll have a use for them later, but for now, I'm just going to talk about them
					and bring them up later.
					If you can figure out the range of values, you should use a <code>for</code> loop, which
					has the syntax:
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">initialization</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">condition</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">next</span> <span class="n">step</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// do stuff</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>First, <code>initialization</code> will run before anything else in the loop runs.
					Then, the loop starts.
					For every iteration of the loop, it will go to the next iteration of the loop if
					<code>condition to check</code> is true, then it will do whatever is between the curly
					braces, then it will do <code>the next step</code>, then it will move to the next iteration
					of the loop.
				</p>
				<p>For example, let's say we want to calculate
					<i>1<sup>2</sup>+2<sup>2</sup>+3<sup>2</sup>+&hellip;+100<sup>2</sup></i>.
					Since we know where to start (<code>1</code>), where to end (<code>100</code>), and the step between
					each number (<code>1</code>), we should use a <code>for</code> loop.

				<p>To be clear, you can convert any <code>for</code> loop into a <code>while</code> loop easily.

				<p>In general, I use a <code>for</code> loop when I know the range and the step I want to
					iterate over and a <code>while</code> loop when I don't know the range.
					As an example, I will use a <code>for</code> loop when you want me to read from the
					seventeenth element of a list until the thirtieth and I will use a <code>while</code> loop
					when I want to start reading at the seventeenth element and continue reading
					until I reach a specified element.
					Since strings end once we reach the null terminator, I will generally use a
					<code>while</code> loop to read strings and a <code>for</code> loop otherwise.

					We have three conditions joined with <code>&&</code>s: <code>str1[i]</code>, <code>str2[i]</code>, and
					<code>str1[i] == str2[i]</code>.
					The first two conditions check if either str has reached the null terminator,
					since <code>'\0'</code> is <code>0</code>, <code>0</code> is false, and <code>false && anything_else</code>&rArr;<code>false</code>.
					In other wordss, <code>str1[i] && str2[1]</code> make sure that we're only performing an
					iteration of the while loop if both strings still have characters we need to
					check.
					The other condition, <code>str1[i] == str2[i]</code> checks if the two characters at the
					same position match.
					If they don't match, then we don't need to check any more characters since the
					strings don't match, so we can exit the while loop.
					The line <code>i += 1</code> adds one to <code>i</code>, effectively moving us to the next character
					in both strings.
				</p>
				<p>Lastly, we leave the <code>while</code> loop, enter the <code>if</code> statement, and check if the
					characters we stopped on are equal.
					If they aren't equal, we would have left the <code>while</code> loop without changing <code>i</code>
					because <code>str1[i] == str2[i]</code> was false, meaning that <code>str1[i]</code> and <code>str2[i]</code> are
					still different characters and the condition <code>str1[i] == str2[i]</code> is still false
					when it's evaluated in the <code>if</code> statement.
					If either <code>str1[i]</code> or <code>str2[i]</code> is <code>'\0'</code>, we'll also exit the while loop, at
					which point the only way the two strings are equal is if both <code>str1[i]</code> and
					<code>str2[i]</code> are <code>'\0'</code>.

				<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
				<p>We've made quite a lot of progress thoughtout this series.
					We went from coming up with a vague idea of stuff we should have in our language
					to coming up with a consistent format for the file itself, creating some syntax
					for comments and arithmetic, declaring and setting variables of different types,
					using variables, accessing memory and memory addresses, handling arrays, and
					representing strings of text.
					In this article, we introduced several new operators (the <b>Relational</b> and
					<b>Logical</b> operators) and a few keywords (<code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>do</code>, and
					<code>for</code>) that will help us control the flow of the program.
				</p>
				<h2 id="whats-next">What's Next</h2>
				<p>Now that we have a way to test if two strings are equal, we still need to be
					able to read from a file and print the count to the screen.
					Since we're putting ourselves in the shoes of Ritchie et al, we need to come up
					ways for programmers to do both.
					We don't want programmers to copy and paste chunks of code into their program
					because it makes it harder for them to find their code and because it means that
					if we have any bugs in our code or features we want to add to our code,
					programmers have to go to each pasted block of code and update every block of
					code.
					There could also be an efficiency cost, but it's situation specific.
					We should have exactly one block of code so that we can fix or upgrade it
					exactly once for every feature or bug.
				</p>
				<p>In the next article, we'll introduce <a
					href="../functions/index.html">Functions in C</a>, which will allow us to
					reuse code without copying it.
