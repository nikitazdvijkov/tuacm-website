				<p><i>This is the fifth article in the </i>Making Sense of C<i> series.</i>
				</p>
				<p>So far, we've determined that we're going to talk to the compiler by telling it
					the name of the file we want it to read and we've determined how to tell the
					compiler to ignore parts of the file we don't want it to read.
					We've also established that our code is going to consist of a bunch of
					statements, but we've never established what a valid statement should look like.
					In this article, we're going to discuss the most basic statements in <code>C</code>:
					variables and basic arithmetic.
				</p>
				<h2 id="topics-covered">Topics Covered</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Variables</b>
					</li>
					<li><b>Arithmetic Operators:</b> <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>%</code>
					</li>
					<li><b>Assignment Operators:</b> <code>=</code>, <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, <code>*=</code>, <code>/=</code>, <code>%=</code>
					</li>
					<li><b>Operator Precedence:</b> How <code>C</code> handles operators and <code>()</code>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 id="value-manipulation">Value Manipulation</h3>
				<p>For <code>C</code> to be a programming language, you'll need to be able to write more than
					comments.
					While there are some complicated things you should be able to do in any
					programming language, we'll focus on the simplest thing we can do: arithmetic.
					You should also be able to store values for later use, otherwise you would have
					to type the entire expression on one line, even if you repeat things.
					In this section, we're going to discuss how to manipulate values using some of
					the basic operators in <code>C</code>, how to store the results in variables, and how to
					use those results later on.
				</p>
				<h4 id="variables">Variables</h4>
				<p>Variables store values for later use.
					To access a variable, we need some way of identifying it, so we'll need to give
					it a name.
					Since explicit types are more efficient than variables, we also need to specify
					the type.
					Since we don't need to specify anything besides the type and the name, our
					statement to declare a variable should just be the name of the variable and its
					type.
				</p>
				<p>We will use the syntax <code>[type] [variable_name];</code> to declare a variable.
					I will discuss types more later in the series, but for now we're just going to
					use one: <code>int</code>, which represents an signed integer (positive whole numbers,
					negative whole numbers, and zero).
					Since we're only dealing with <code>int</code>s, our variable declarations will look like
					<code>int a;</code>.
					You can only use a variable after it's declared (remember that the compiler
					reads your code top to bottom, left to right) and you can only declare a
					variable once.
					Once a variable is defined, it cannot change its type for reasons we'll specify
					later.
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">;</span>          <span class="c1">// ERROR: redeclaration of a</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>You can also declare multiple variables of the same type on one line.
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<h5 id="naming-variables">Naming Variables</h5>
				<p>We can't use a semicolon, <code>/*</code>, <code>*/</code>, <code>//</code>, or a space since they're already
					reserved.
					For now, let's just say that we can use any letters or digits to name a
					variable.
					We also can't use any reserved symbols like <code>+-/*%</code> in our names or use any
					reserved words, like <code>int</code>.
					We can use something like <code>sum_of_ints</code>, we just can't use the name <code>int</code>.
					Since we also might want spaces, we can use the underscore (<code>_</code>) to represent a
					space.
					Lastly, we don't want numbers at the beginning of variables, since someone could
					see something like <code>4x</code> and think that <code>x</code> is the variable and it's getting
					multiplied by four, so the first character can't be a number.
				</p>
				<p>Here are a list of valid variables names:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><code>number_of_apples</code>
					</li>
					<li><code>distance_from_sun</code>
					</li>
					<li><code>sum_of_squares</code>
					</li>
					<li><code>numberOfApples</code>
					</li>
					<li><code>x3</code>
					</li>
					<li><code>fsadlj</code>
					</li>
					<li><code>FSAD324jds</code>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="aside" >
					<h5>Naming Conventions</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>In general, I use <b>snake_case</b> when I name my variables, meaning each word
						is separated with underscores, like in the first three examples above.
						A lot of people prefer to not use underscores because it's extra typing, so they
						use <b>camelCase</b>, in which the first letter of every word except the first
						is capitalized and every variable only contains letters.
					</p>
					<p>I find <b>snake_case</b> easier to read, so I use it.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p><b>You should make sure to always give anything you can name a descriptive name,
					including variables</b>.
					For example, what do you think the first four variables store in the list above?
					What if you see something in your code that looks like <code>number_of_apples +
					distance_from_sun</code>?
					Would it make sense to add those variables?
					On the other hand, what if you saw <code>fsadlj + x3</code>?
					Does it make sense to add those variables?
					How could you tell?
				</p>
				<p>Giving things descriptive names will save you a lot of headache in the future.
					Of course, there is a balance between descriptiveness and verboseness.
					For example, I could have called <code>sum_of_squares</code>,
					<code>sum_of_the_first_one_hundred_squares_counting_one_hundred_squared</code>, but that's
					way too much to type and all I need to know to not confuse it with other
					variables or to recognize when I'm using it when I shouldn't is that the
					variable stores a sum of squares.
				</p>
				<h4 id="arithmetic-operators">Arithmetic Operators</h4>
				<p>Since you're programming, you probably want to do some math operations like
					addition, subtraction, etc., so let's just reserve the normal math symbols for
					these basic operations right off the bat.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><code>+</code>:&emsp;Adds two values.
					</li>
					<li><code>-</code>:&emsp;Subtracts two values.
					</li>
					<li><code>/</code>:&emsp;Divides two values (<span id="integer-division">Ignores the
						fractional part for whole number/integral operands and you can't divide by
						zero</span>).
					</li>
					<li><code>*</code>:&emsp;Multiplies two values.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>and they all have the syntax <code>15 &bull; 12</code>, where <code>&bull;</code> is one of the
					arithmetic operators.
				</p>
				<p>You probably also want to be able to use negative numbers, so let's say that if
					a <code>-</code> shows up before a number, we'll make the number negative.
					The <code>-</code> also functions just like a negative sign does in normal math, where <code>-13
					* 5</code>&rArr;<code>-65</code>.
				</p>
				<p>The last basic arithmetic operation you'll likely need is the ability to get the
					remainder of a division.
					Remember that we're looking for unused, unpaired (parentheses, curly brackets,
					less than, greater than, and square brackets are out) printable characters that
					will be on everyone's keyboards.
					After assigning everything else, we find that our only choices to represent the
					remainder division are <code>@</code> and <code>%</code>.
					Since <code>%</code> is more related to arithmetic than an <code>@</code> symbol, we'll use <code>%</code>.
				</p>
				<p>The <code>%</code> operator is specifically defined so that, for any two whole numbers, <code>(a
					/ b) * b + (a % b)</code> must equal <code>a</code>.
					Since the remainder is only defined for integer division, <code>%</code> only works on
					whole numbers.
					For example:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><code>17 % 4</code>&rArr;<code>1</code>
					</li>
					<li><code>32 % 10</code>&rArr;<code>2</code>
					</li>
					<li><code>1.2 % 3</code> won't compile because <code>1.2</code> isn't an integer.
					</li>
					<li><code>4 % 1.3</code> also won't compile because <code>1.3</code> isn't an integer
					</li>
					<li><code>1000 % 13</code>&rArr;<code>12</code>
					</li>
					<li><code>(-1000) % 13</code>&rArr;<code>-12</code>
					</li>
					<li><code>1000 % (-13)</code>&rArr;<code>12</code>
					</li>
					<li><code>(-1000) % (-13)</code>&rArr;<code>-12</code>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>From the last four, we can see that the remainder has the same sign as what
					comes before the <code>%</code> regardless of the sign of what comes after <code>%</code>.
				</p>
				<p>Now that you can do some basic arithmetic in <code>C</code>, let's look into how to store
					the results.
				</p>
				<h4 id="assignment-operators">Assignment Operators</h4>
				<p>First and foremost, <code>=</code> stores the value on the right in the variable on the
					left.
					Things that can be assigned in <code>C</code> are called <b>lvalues</b> (<b><i>l</i></b>eft
					<b><i>values</i></b>) and thing that cannot be assigned in <code>C</code> are called
					<b>rvalues</b> (<b><i>r</i></b>ight <b><i>values</i></b>) because <b>rvalues
					<i>cannot appear</i> on the left side of an assignment operator</b> and
					<b>lvalues <i>can appear</i> on the left side of an assignment operator</b>.
				</p>
				<p>For example:
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">;</span>              <span class="c1">// a now contains 7</span>

<span class="c1">// You can also declare and use = on the same line, like so</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>      <span class="c1">// b now contains 6</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">;</span>      <span class="c1">// a is replaced with 7 and b is replaced with 6, so now</span>
                    <span class="c1">// c contains 13</span>
                    <span class="c1">// Notice that variables (lvalues) can show up on the right</span>
                    <span class="c1">// side of an assignment operator</span>

<span class="mi">6</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">;</span>              <span class="c1">// Throws an error and won&#39;t compile</span>

<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">;</span>             <span class="c1">// a now contains 15, c still contains 13</span>
<span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span>         <span class="c1">// c contains 130</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>The last line can be shortened to <code>c *= 10;</code>.
				</p>
				<p>In fact, all the other assignment operators work identically.
					<code>a &bull;= [rvalue];</code> is exactly equivalent to <code>a = a &bull; ([rvalue]);</code>, where
					<code>a</code> is a variable, <code>&bull;</code> is <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, or <code>%</code>, and [rvalue] is any
					expression that results in a number.
					It's just a little <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntactic sugar</a> to save
					you some typing.
				</p>
				<p>The last thing to note is that <code>[lvalue] &bull; [rvalue]</code> (where <code>&bull;</code>
					represents one of the assignment operators) actually returns the <code>[rvalue]</code>, so
					you could write something like
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">7</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>        <span class="c1">// b is set to 6, then (b = 6) is replaced with 6,</span>
                            <span class="c1">// so the right hand side becomes 7 + 6</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<div class="aside" >
					<h5>Just Because You Can Doesn't Mean You Should</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>When you write code, you aren't just writing code for the computer, you're
						writing code for everyone who reads your code, including yourself.
						You should write code that you'll be able to understand a year from now, which
						generally means that you shouldn't write bad code that uses obscure or
						surprising features of the language just to be clever.
					</p>
					<p>Using clever tricks in your code is like using big words.
						If you use them because using anything else would be more inefficient, more
						complicated, or impossible, then using them is fine.
						If you use them because you want to impress people, then you're going to look
						like an idiot when you mess up and people won't want to interact with you.
					</p>
					<p>In the case of using the fact that <code>a = b</code> returns <code>b</code>, I wouldn't recommend
						using it.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3 id="operator-precedence">Operator Precedence</h3>
				<p>Say that you have this code:
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">17</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">30</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">50</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>To determine the value of <code>a</code>, we need to have some sort of order in which to do
					the operations.
					For example, we could do the operations left to right, but then we would
					calculate <code>1 + 30 / 3</code> as <code>(1 + 30) / 3</code> &rArr; <code>31 / 3</code> &rArr; <code>10</code> (it gets
					rounded to zero because we're using <a href="#integer-division"
					onclick="highlight_link(this, '#EEBBBB')">integer division</a>).
					If we were using the regular order of operations, we would evaluate <code>1 + 30 /
					3</code> as <code>1 + (30 / 3)</code> &rArr; <code>1 + 10</code> &rArr; <code>11</code>.
					In <code>C</code>, there is a strict order of operations listed <a
					href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/operator_precedence">here</a>.
				</p>
				<p>In practice:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I only remember that anything in parenthesis gets done before anything outside
						the parentheses, the normal PEMDAS rules, and the assignment operators go last.
					</li>
					<li>I only ever have assignment operators as the leftmost elements and they're
						evaluated last.
					</li>
					<li>Everything else goes in parentheses.
						It's a little bit more to type, but it helps prevent errors.
					</li>
					<li>I split up expressions into multiple lines by concepts and by similar
						operations (i.e. anything you can read from left to right without understanding
						operator precedence).
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The less energy you have to spend on figuring out the result of an expression,
					the better.
				</p>
				<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
				<p>Up to this point, we've established that we're going to give our compiler a file
					with a series of statements without giving examples of these statements.
					In this article, we've established what some statements will look like.
					Our file should now look like
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">;</span>                  <span class="c1">// I could have combined these lines into &quot;int a = 7;&quot;</span>
<span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a_cubed</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">;</span>    <span class="c1">// Just some basic multiplication</span>

<span class="n">other</span> <span class="n">statement</span><span class="p">;</span>        <span class="c1">// We still haven&#39;t established what other statements</span>
                        <span class="c1">// would look like.</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">/=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="n">other</span> <span class="n">statement</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<h2 id="whats-next">What's Next</h2>
				<p>Before we go onto the next topic in <code>C</code>, we need to take a detour to explain
					how computers handle memory, as we're going to introduce types that won't
					appear to have any use cases unless you understand <a
					href="https://tuacm.com/blog/memory-hierarchy/index.html">how your computer
					handles memory</a>.
					I strongly recommend that you read the article before moving on.
				</p>
				<p>We also can also discuss <a
					href="https://tuacm.com/blog/integers/index.html">how computers represent
					integral types</a> and <a
					href="https://tuacm.com/blog/floating-point/index.html">how computers represent
					floating point types</a>, but knowing how to represent them isn't as important
					for understanding <code>C</code>.
					Without the knowledge about how computers represent numbers, you're just going
					to have to accept that the language is the way it is without any explanation
					why.
				</p>
				<p>Once we've covered those two detours, we'll move on to dealing with the <a
					href="../types/index.html">fundamental types in <code>C</code></a>.
