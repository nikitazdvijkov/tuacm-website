				<p><i>This is the eleventh article in the </i>Making Sense of C<i> series.
					In this article, we're going to come up with some way of telling the computer
					where to start executing commands and some way of getting user input somewhere
					into your program.</i>
				</p>
				<p>In the last article, we established both the syntax of defining and calling
					functions in <code>C</code>, but we need some way of getting user input from the command
					line and we need some way of telling the computer which function to start from.
					In this article, we'll establish the <code>main</code> function, which serves as an entry
					point in <code>C</code> and we'll write the basics of our first program.
				</p>
				<div class="aside" >
					<h5>Minor Detours</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>Since I want us to get the first program written soon, I'm going to gloss over a
						few things for now, such as the distinction between the stack and the heap, how
						your computer actually allocates variables, dynamic memory allocation, etc.
						These topics are important for understanding how to program well in <code>C</code>, but
						they aren't strictly necessary for the first program.
						Anything more complicated than a simple program will require you to understand
						these topics.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h2 id="entry-point">Entry Point</h2>
				<p>There are several possible ways to tell the computer the first statement to
					execute.
					Generally, interpreted languages start with the top of source code file, read
					through it, and execute each line from top to bottom.
					For example, an oversimplified <code>python</code> file would look like
				</p>
				<div class="code-blocktable">
<table><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Alphabet&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Soup&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>				
				</div>
				<p>and the <code>python</code> interpreter would start at the top, see <code>print("Alphabet")</code>,
					print <code>Alphabet</code> to the terminal, see <code>print("Soup")</code>, print <code>Soup</code> to the
					terminal, then exit the program.
					You would execute the program using
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre>
<span class="terminal-oneline"><span style="color:#3734E2;"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#FF0070;"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ python3 basic.py</span>
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>where <code>basic.py</code> is the name of the file.
				</p>
				<p>Just reading the code from top to bottom won't work in <code>C</code> since <code>C</code> is a
					compiled language with multiple compilation units (source files), which I'll
					explain later.
					Instead, we need to use some label to tell the computer that you want it to
					start with a specific block of code.
				</p>
				<h2 id="the-main-function">The <code>main</code> Function</h2>
				<p>In <code>C</code>, we use the <code>main</code> function to start the program and it has two possible
					ways of writing it.
					If you don't want to take in any user input on the command line, you can use
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Do stuff</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>On the other hand, if you want to take in user input on the command line, you
					can use
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">**</span> <span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Do stuff</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

					<h5>Variations on Entry Points in <code>C</code></h5>
					<hr>
					<p>For now, we're working on <code>C</code> on its own and not part of a framework.
						Furthermore, we aren't taking in any environment variables.
						In either of these cases, the entry point in <code>C</code> can be different.
						For example, both POSIX (Linux and Mac) and Windows support a third way of
						writing <code>main</code>:
					</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">**</span> <span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">**</span> <span class="n">envp</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Do stuff</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
					
					<p>where the last argument is a list of all the environment variables.
						Environment variables contain things like your current directory, <a
						href="https://tuacm.com/blog/posix/commands/" title="How to Make a Command in
						Linux or Mac">where all your command line executables are</a>.
					</p>
					<p>Furthermore, other programs may use a different name for the entry point, such
						as <code>WinMain</code> for some Windows programs.
					</p>
					<p>Once again, we are just going to use the standard <code>main</code> function since we're
						writing freestanding <code>C</code> programs.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>Let's break these functions apart, starting with the easiest to explain: <code>main</code>.
				</p>
				<h3 id="why-main">Why <code>main</code>?</h3>
				<p>Since we need a name for our entry point function, we have to choose a name that
					makes sense.
					The shortest word we can use to indicate that the function is the center of our
					program is <code>main</code>.
					We could have made it <code>start</code> or <code>begin</code> or something else, but we decided to
					stick with <code>main</code>.
				</p>
				<h3 id="why-return-an-int">Why Return an <code>int</code>?</h3>
				<p>Let's say that you need a file to exist or else your program cannot run.
					For example, let's say that you provide the name of a file that doesn't exist to
					our program to count words.
					We can't count words in files that do not exist, so what should we do?
					In our case, we can print out an error saying <code>"Error: File does not exist!"</code>
					and the user can figure out what to do from there, but what happens if we have a
					program whose output cannot be read by a user, such as a server that needs to
					run automatically or an embedded system that doesn't have a screen?
					If we knew the error, we could write some more code that handles it for us.
					For example, if the file does not exist, then might run a different program to
					figure out why the file doesn't exist.
					We need some way of telling the other program that the file did not exist.
				</p>
				<p>The simplest way to do so is to return an <code>int</code> with some value that indicates
					either that everything went smoothly or what went wrong.
					For example, let's say that <code>main</code> will return a <code>0</code> if nothing went wrong and a
					<code>1</code> if our file was missing.
					If we have other errors, we can use other numbers.
					For example, if someone gives us a value that we cannot use as one of our
					inputs, let's return <code>2</code>.
					Eventually, we'll get to some standard error codes in <code>errno.h</code>, but don't worry
					about it for now.
					In our case, we just need to put <code>return 0;</code> at the end of the <code>main</code> function,
					since we're not going to use them that often.
				</p>
				<p>In short, the value returned from <code>main</code> tells the computer how the program
					ended.
				</p>
				<h3 id="what-is-argc">What is <code>argc</code>?</h3>
				<p>When you execute a command on the command line, it generally looks like
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre>
<span class="terminal-oneline"><span style="color:#3734E2;"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#FF0070;"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ command first_argument second_argument third_argument</span>
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>Without going into too much depth on the syntax of the command line, <code>argc</code> is
					the number of words you type in, where each word is separated by whitespace.
					If we were to type in the command <code>command a b c d</code>, <code>argc</code> would be <code>5</code>.
					If we were to type in the command <code>command</code>, <code>argc</code> would be <code>1</code>.
				</p>
				<p>For our first program, we just need to make sure that our users have given us
					the program name, the file the user wants to read, and the word that the user
					wants to check, so we need to make sure that we have at least three arguments.
					If we don't have at least three arguments, we should just exit the program and
					print out something like a usage message.
					Since we now have something our program needs to do, we can start writing our
					<code>main</code> function.
				</p>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>				
				</div>
				<p>We still don't have the functionality to print out the usage message and we
					haven't written the code to count the number of words, but we'll get there.
				</p>
				<h3 id="what-even-is-a-char-">What Even is a <code>char **</code>?</h3>
				<p>As you know, we're using a <code>char *</code> to represent strings, so what is a <code>char
					**</code>?
				</p>
				<p>When we represent lists, we generally allocate a contiguous block of memory and
					return the memory address of the first element of the block of memory.
					For example, we represent a string as a list of characters, so we use the syntax
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">string</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;This is an example.&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>Immediately after allocating the memory, though, <code>string</code> is a <code>char *</code> that
					holds the memory address of the first character.
					We access each individual character using the syntax <code>string[offset]</code>, which is
					a shorter version of <code>*(string + offset)</code>.
					Likewise, we said that if we wanted a list of numbers, we could use the syntax
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">list_of_integers</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="mi">32</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">75</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">85</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">44</span> <span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>Immediately after allocating the memory, though, <code>list_of_integers</code> is a pointer
					that holds the memory address of the first number.
					We access each individual number using <code>list_of_integers[offset]</code>, which is a
					shorter version of <code>*(list_of_integers + offset)</code>.
				</p>
				<p>So what if we want a list of strings?
					Well, the general syntax for declaring a list of anything is <code>type
					array_name[count];</code> and the type of a string is a <code>char *</code>, so we can declare a
					list of strings using the syntax.
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">list_of_strings</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s">&quot;First string&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Second String&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;Third String&quot;</span> <span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>But remember that after you declare an array using <code>type array_name[count];</code>,
					the variable <code>array_name</code> will be <code>type *</code>.
					So if you were to declare an array of <code>char *</code>, the type of the array variable
					would be <code>char **</code>.
				</p>
				<p>In short, <code>argv</code> is a <code>char **</code> because it is an array of strings, specifically
					each word on the command line.
					For example, if you were to type
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre>
<span class="terminal-oneline"><span style="color:#3734E2;"><b>joseph@tutorials</b></span>:<span style="color:#FF0070;"><b>~/dev</b></span>$ command first_argument second_argument third_argument</span>
</pre>
				</div>
				<p><code>argv</code> would contain <code> { "command", "first_argument", "second_argument",
					"third_argument" } </code>.
					You can then use it like a normal array, where <code>argv[0]</code> would be <code>"command"</code>,
					<code>argv[1]</code> would be <code>"first_argument"</code>, etc.
					In general, <code>argv[0]</code> in <code>main</code> is the name of the executable.
				</p>
				<h2 id="the-main-function-in-our-program">The <code>main</code> Function in Our Program</h2>
				<p>As we've discussed earlier, we've already come up with something to check to
					make sure that we have enough arguments, but we also need some standard way to
					read the arguments.
					In our case, let's make the first argument the file and the second argument the
					word we want to count.
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">**</span> <span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">argc</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// TODO: Print Usage Message</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">file_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">];</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>All we did is give names to the arguments given to the function, but now we've
					taken care of everything related to the main function and now we can write
					functions for the usage message and counting the number of occurrences in a file
					and we're done.
				</p>
				<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
				<p>In this article, we learned about the <code>main</code> function, which allows us to get
					user input on the command line and serves as the entry point in the program.

				<p>As you can see, we've covered quite a lot of ground.
					We can now write complete programs that can mess with user input, but we
					currently have no way for us to see the output of any of our programs.
					We can't print our output to the terminal and we can't save our output to a
					file, so we'll need to implement those features soon.

				<p>In the next article, <a href="../header-files/">Header Files in C</a>, we're
					going to discuss how your compiler uses the symbol table and how you can use
