				<p><i>This is the third article in the </i>Making Sense of C<i> series.</i>
				</p>
				<p>In the last article, we decided that we were going to come up with a way to add
					notes (more commonly known as <b>comments</b>, which we'll use throughout the
					rest of the series) to the file that our compiler was going to ignore.
					In practice, this will allow you to explain things about the code that won't be
					clear from reading the code itself.
					For example, you may need to explain the algorithm you're using, the structure
					of the code, why you did X instead of Y, etc., but the computer doesn't care.
					For this tutorial, I'm going to need to explain what certain lines of code are
					doing, and the best way to do so is to write a note near the line.
				</p>
				<h2 id="topics-covered">Topics Covered</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><b>How Should We Tell the Compiler to Ignore Our Comments?</b>
					</li>
					<li><b>When Should We Use Comments?</b>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 id="how-should-we-tell-the-compiler-to-ignore-our-comments">How Should We Tell the Compiler to Ignore Our Comments?</h3>
				<p>So now, you have a problem: you need to be able to write things that the
					compiler will ignore but other people can read, which we call <b>comments</b>.
				</p>
				<p>Since our computer will only be able to process the keys on the keyboard, our
					file can only have the standard printable ASCII characters (though we'll
					probably add support for Unicode later after we invent it).
					Our only option is to mark the comments with a sequence of ASCII characters.
				</p>
				<p>Since we haven't established what the language looks like, it could be anything.
					Python and bash (which both came after <code>C</code>), for instance, use <code>#</code> to comment
					out everything after it, which makes sense since many of the other symbols are
					already used up.
					HTML (which also came after <code>C</code>) uses <code>&lt;!--</code> and <code>--&gt;</code> to comment out
					everything between them, which makes sense since <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> are
					the main metacharacters in html.
				</p>
				<p>Dennis Ritchie (the guy who made <code>C</code>) decided to support both single line (like
					in python and bash) and multiline (like in html) comments in <code>C</code>.
					Single line comments use <code>//</code> and comment out the rest of the line while
					multiline comments use <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> and comment out anything between them.
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Not</span> <span class="n">commented</span> <span class="n">out</span><span class="p">;</span>      <span class="c1">// Commented out</span>

<span class="c1">// Entire line is commented out.</span>

<span class="cm">/* Also commented out</span>
<span class="cm">but now it can go onto multiple lines.</span>
<span class="cm">The compiler will never do anything with this line, but the person reading the</span>
<span class="cm">source code</span>
<span class="cm">will be able to see it.</span>
<span class="cm">*/</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<p>In the rest of the tutorial, I will mostly use comments to explain how <code>C</code> works
					in the code.
					The comments that have <code>// do stuff</code> in them indicate that you could do
					anything valid in <code>C</code> that you want, so I can't be specific.
				</p>
				<h3 id="when-should-we-use-comments">When Should We Use Comments?</h3>
				<p>Comments should be used sparingly because your code should be clean enough to
					read on its own.
					<b>Good code is self-documenting</b> is thrown around so often that a version of
					it is in the <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_(computer_programming)#Code_description">Wikipedia
					article for comments in programming</a>.
				</p>
				<p>The Wikipedia article lists several use cases for comments, but I'll explain two
					easy ways to avoid using unnecessary comments:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Whenever you have a chance to name something, you should give it a
						descriptive name</b>.
						If it weren't inefficient to have an entire article consisting of the previous
						sentence repeated hundreds of times, I would write that article.
						As a compromise, I'm just going to repeat it every chance I get in every article
						in the future.
						You don't have to use a long name to name something, but you should have enough
						information in the name to understand how the thing you're naming fits into the
						program.
						For example:
						<ul>
							<li>You should not name a variable <code>a</code> if <code>a</code> represents the sum of the first five
								million digits of &pi;.
								You should call it something like <code>sum_digits_of_pi</code> or shorten it to <code>sum_digits</code> if it's clear that you are referring to the digits of pi.
							</li>
							<li>You should not name a function <code>calculate</code> unless it will just evaluate an
								arbitrary expression like a calculator would.
								If you have a function to calculate the sum of the first n digits of <code>pi</code>, you
								should call it something like <code>sum_first_n_digits</code>.
								Again, you can shorten it if it would still make sense in the context of the
								code.
							</li>
							<li>If you're dealing with an x-coordinate, feel free to call it <code>x</code>.
							</li>
							<li>If you're dealing with the index of an element in a list, feel free to use the
								standard <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, and <code>k</code>.
								If you need to use more than <code>i</code>, <code>j</code> and <code>k</code>, you should probably stop and
								clean up your code.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>If a section of code gets so complicated that you feel a need to add comments to
						tell people what it does, you should break it up into smaller parts.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Now, I want to make an explicit exception on what I've said about comments for
					your company policy.
					If your boss tells you to write a comment for every character on the screen, you
					write a comment for every character on the screen.
					Don't blame me if you get fired for not fulfilling a job requirement.
				</p>
				<p>You may try to convince your boss that you shouldn't need to comment everything,
					but do what he or she says until your boss changes his or her mind.
				</p>
				<div class="aside" >
					<h5>Do as I Say, Not as I Do in the Early Parts of the Tutorial</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>Although I told you to use comments sparingly, I will use them frequently
						throughout this tutorial to help you better understand what's happening.
						If I were to write any of the code I'm going to write for actual use, I would
						have way fewer comments.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
				<p>So far, we've decided that we're going to put our code into a file and give our
					compiler the name of the file so it can turn it into machine code.
					We've also established that if we don't want the compiler to read parts of the
					file we give to it, we either use the character sequence <code>//</code> to comment out the
					rest of the line and the two character sequences <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> to comment out
					everything between them.
				</p>
				<p>Our file should now look like
				</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span></span><span class="n">first</span> <span class="n">statement</span><span class="p">;</span>        <span class="c1">// Here&#39;s why I used the phrase &quot;first statement&quot;</span>
                        <span class="c1">// instead of &quot;statement one&quot;</span>
<span class="n">second</span> <span class="n">statement</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">third</span> <span class="n">statement</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
				
				<h2 id="whats-next">What's Next</h2>
				<p>I decided to get comments out of the way early on because you don't need to know
					anything about <code>C</code> to understand comments and because I'll need to use them
					throughout the tutorial to explain what code does.
				</p>
				<p>In the next article, we're going to be <a
					href="../first-programs/index.html">Coming Up with Our First Program in
					C</a>, which will help us figure out what features we need to implement in <code>C</code>.
