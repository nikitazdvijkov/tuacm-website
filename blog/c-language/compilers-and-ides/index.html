				<p><i>This is the fourteenth article in the </i>Making Sense of C<i> series.
					In this article, we're going to discuss text editors, how to use a compiler as
					part of an IDE, and how to use an IDE.</i>
				</p>
				<p>In the last article, we established that we had four things left to do before we
					could write our first program:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>set up and use a compiler,
					</li>
					<li>familiarize ourselves with an IDE/text editor,
					</li>
					<li>figure out a way to print something out to the terminal,
					</li>
					<li>and figure out a way to read from a file.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In this article, we're going to discuss the main components of an IDE:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the project file,
					</li>
					<li>the compiler,
					</li>
					<li>the code executor (i.e. the thing that runs the code),
					</li>
					<li>the text editor,
					</li>
					<li>the file manager,
					</li>
					<li>the output windows.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 id="general-features-of-an-ide">General Features of an IDE</h2>
				<p>In this section, we're going to discuss features that are common across pretty
					much all IDEs.
					To start, an IDE is a program that can do almost anything you would need to do
					to write a program.
					In fact, IDE is short for <b>Integrated Development Environment</b>, which means
					it's a singular programming environment that allows you to write, compile, run,
					and debug code within it.
				</p>
				<p>An IDE will try to look like programs you're used to like, Microsoft Word,
					Excel, or Google Docs.
					I've made a simplified version of an IDE below.

				<p>If the "image" above looks weird on your phone, turn your phone sideways.
				</p>
				<p>As you can see, the top of the IDE will have tabs like "File" and "View" plus
					the minimize, maximize, and close buttons, which will work just like they work
					in almost every other program.
					Under that, you have a bunch of buttons that do things like save your current
					file, undo something, redo something, build the project, do stuff with files,
					run the program, and search through the project for some sort of text.
					You'll also have a project explorer that will display all the relevant files in
					the project, which mainly consist of source code files, on the left.
					To the right of the project explorer, you'll have a text editor with some syntax
					highlighting.
					You type your code in the text editor and save it as you would normally expect.
					Under that, you have at least two tabs: one for the output of building the
					project (which include which files were compiled and any warnings or errors
					that showed up) and one for the output of the program itself.
				</p>
				<p>To be clear, most IDEs have the features I've described, though they allow users
					to do things like move each of the windows around, add and remove tabs, add
					buttons, etc.
				</p>
				<h3 id="the-project-file">The Project File</h3>
				<p>Since we want to save information about how to compile our source code and send
					that information to other people, we need some sort of project file.
					The project file consists of anything your computer needs to know about to
					compile your project properly.
					It includes a list of all the source code files (code that you write), libraries
					(code that other people have written and compiled for you that you can use in
					your own projects), and directories you want to include in your project.
					It also includes information you can tell the compiler about how you want to
					compile projects.
					If you're using an IDE, you will go through the settings in the IDE to modify
					the file.
					When you compile and link your project, it will go through the project file and
					figure out what to compile and how to compile it.
				</p>
				<p>While the project file is important under the hood, you as a programmer probably
					don't need to worry about it directly, though we'll discuss how to make one
					first by hand then by using other programs.
					In most IDEs, you'll find the ability to create a new project by going to
					<b>File</b> (Top Left Corner) &gt; <b>New</b> &gt; <b>Project</b>.
					You can add source files by right-clicking on the project name in the project
					explorer (which you can find in either <b>View</b> or <b>Window</b> in the bar
					at the top of the screen with <b>File</b> and clicking something like <b>Add New
					File</b> or <b>Add</b> &gt; <b>File</b>).
				</p>
				<p>These project files are often platform specific, so people will use tools like
					<code>cmake</code> and <code>premake</code> to generate project files for each platform so you don't
					have to worry about it.
				</p>
				<h3 id="the-compiler">The Compiler</h3>
				<p>We'll also want some way of compiling the code within the IDE, so we're going to
					build a compiler into the program or let the user modify the project to use a
					specific compiler.
					Either way, we're going to have a button somewhere on the screen that will
					compile the code and we're probably going to have a tab at the top of the screen
					titled something like <b>Build</b>.
				</p>
				<p>After compiling a file, the IDE will save the compiled file (known as an object
					file) so that it doesn't have to recompile the entire project every time.
					The project file and the compiler will work together to only compile what needs
					to be compiled, which consists of pretty much any source code file that has
					changed since it was last compiled or any source code file that doesn't have a
					corresponding object file.
					You won't see much of a difference for smaller projects, but larger projects can
					sometimes take hours to compile from scratch.
				</p>
				<p>All IDEs have four major options to build code:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Build:</b> Compiles all the modified and new files and links everything
						together to get you a working executable, working executables, or a library
						(<b>libraries are just a bunch of compiled object files glued together in one
						file</b>, similar to how you can zip a bunch of files into one file).
					</li>
					<li><b>Clean:</b> Gets rid of all the object files so that you compile all the files
						the next time you <b>Build</b> your project.
					</li>
					<li><b>Rebuild:</b> Recompiles all the files specified in the project file and links
						everything together.
						You can get the same results by running <b>Clean</b> then <b>Build</b>.
					</li>
					<li><b>Compile:</b> Compile a specific file without linking it.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In general, you want to <b>Build</b> your code unless something weird happened
					and you need to <b>Rebuild</b> your code.
					Most IDEs will have a button somewhere that looks like a hammer or some other
					tool you would use to build something that will allow you to build code.
					Also, building will often save any unsaved files, but not necessarily.
				</p>
				<h3 id="the-code-executor">The Code Executor</h3>
				<p>Compiling is cool and all, but you need to be able to run your code to make sure
					it actually works.
					So somewhere on the screen you'll see a Play button that will run your code.
					Sometimes, it will also save your unsaved files and build what it needs to
					build.
					There's also an option to run the code in the toolbar at the top, but different
					IDEs have it in different places, but <b>Run</b> is a good start if it exists.
					There's also a version of the code executor called the debugger that will run
					the code, but you can tell it to do certain things like watch variables or stop
					at a certain point in the code so you can look at the entire program step by
					step and see what's going wrong.
					It often uses a Bug icon if it's in the button toolbar, but you can also find it
					anywhere you can run the code.
					For example, if you have a play button, it could have a drop down menu to the
					right that will have the option to run the debugger.
					If you have a <b>Run</b> tab at the top of the IDE, you'll find the ability to
					run the debugger in that tab.
				</p>
				<h3 id="the-text-editor">The Text Editor</h3>
				<p>You write your code in this window.
					Text editors have several features, most notably syntax highlighting, auto
					indentation, some form of autocomplete, an error checking mechanism, line
					numbers, etc.
					They also allow you to edit multiple files at once using tabs like tabs in a
					browser.
				</p>
				<h3 id="the-file-manager">The File Manager</h3>
				<p>The file manager works just like you would expect.
					It allows you to create files, open files, edit files, etc.
					It's pretty much contained in the <b>File</b> tab at the top of the screen and
					the project manager.
				</p>
				<h3 id="the-output-windows">The Output Windows</h3>
				<p>These windows serve as output for different parts of the IDE.
					You'll always have one for outputting the status of the build, which consists of
					which files were compiled and any warnings or errors found.
					You can also have another window that prints out the result of your program.
				</p>
				<h3 id="other-features">Other Features</h3>
				<p>You can often change settings all you want, import plugins, change the
					background and the colors used in syntax highlighting, etc.
					I recommend that you should change the background to some form of dark mode or
					use a theme with a dark background.
				</p>
				<h2 id="which-ide-to-use">Which IDE to Use?</h2>
				<p>The IDE you use barely matters.
					They all have the same core features and everything else they have is just a
					minor feature that might make you develop faster, though some IDEs might be
					faster than other IDEs.
					The compiler does matter, however.
					Most compilers are platform dependent, so <code>gcc</code> won't compile programs for
					Windows and the <code>Visual C++</code> compiler will only compile programs for Windows.
					In short, you need to make sure to pick an IDE that allows you to compile for
					your system and your target system.
				</p>
				<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
				<p>If you're on Windows, you should either use a cross platform IDE like Eclipse or
					Netbeans or install some form of Linux, which you can do by setting up the
					<a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/tutorial-install-linux-on-windows-wsl/">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> or by <a
					href="https://tuacm.com/blog/virtual-box-shared-folder-clipboard">installing a
					virtual machine like Virtual Box</a> and installing Linux on the virtual
					machine.
					If you choose to set up either the Windows Subsystem for Linux or install the
					Virtual Machine with a Linux distro, you can use the terminal to install the
					<code>gcc</code> compiler (which is necessary for a lot of programs to properly install, so
					you might as well install it) and you can install <code>mingw</code> to build programs for
					Windows in <code>C</code>.
					If you compile something with <code>gcc</code>, then it will work within the Linux part of
					your computer, which includes the Windows Subsytem for Linux or within the
					virtual machine.
					If you compile something with <code>mingw</code>, then it will work on the Windows part of
					your computer.
					If you want graphical output, you have to install a virtual machine.
					If you want to use Eclipse on Windows, someone else has already written an
					article on <a
					href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/How-do-I-set-up-C-Cplusplus-on-Eclipse-in-Windows">setting
					up Eclipse in Windows for C/C++ development</a>.
				</p>
				<p>I threw a lot at you, so if you feel confused at any point, here's <b>the
					simplest way to get our basic <code>C</code> programs to compile on Windows</b>:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Set up the <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/tutorial-install-linux-on-windows-wsl/">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> using the linked tutorial.
					</li>
					<li>Download VSCode or any other text editor, but if you don't know which one to
						get, just download VSCode.
					</li>
					<li>Open up the Ubuntu App
					</li>
					<li>In the Ubuntu App, type the command <code>sudo apt install gcc g++ gdb git make</code> to
						install all the programs after the word <code>install</code> (you probably already have
						several of them, but it's good to make sure that you have them).
					</li>
					<li>Create a folder somewhere on your computer where you're going to put all your
						projects.
						For example, let's say you put it in <code>C:\Users\&#8203;[username]\dev</code>, where
						<code>[username]</code> is your username.
					</li>
					<li>Inside your projects folder, create another folder for a specific project.
						Since we have to do "Hello, World!", we're going to have the folder
						<code>C:\Users\&#8203;[username]\dev&#8203;\hello-world</code>.
					</li>
					<li>Put all your <code>.c</code> and <code>.h</code> files in that folder. We will use build tools like
						<code>make</code>, <code>cmake</code>, or <code>premake</code> later in this series, but we're keeping it simple
						for now.
						Use your text editor to create your files in the folder and write the code.
						In our case, we're going to create the file
						<code>C:\Users\&#8203;[username]\dev&#8203;\hello-world\&#8203;hello-world.c</code> and we're
						going to put the following code in the file.
						<div class="code-blocktable">

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>						
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>On the command line in the Ubuntu app, type <code>cd /mnt/c/[dir]</code>, where <code>[dir]</code> is
						everything after <code>C:</code> in the path of the project folder, but with all the
						backslashes replaced with forward slashes.
						In our case, it's <code>Users/&#8203;[username]/dev&#8203;/hello-world</code>.
						<div class="terminal"><pre>
<span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#3734E2;">joseph@tutorials</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#FF0070;">~/dev</span></b>$ cd /mnt/c/users/[username]/dev/hello-world</span>

</pre>
						</div>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>From here, compiling on all operating systems is the same and we'll cover it in
					the section on <a href="#compiling-on-the-command-line">Compiling on the Command
					Line</a>.
					For now, we're going to talk about the other operating systems.
				</p>
				<h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>
				<p>If you're on Linux, you should probably use a decent text editor like VSCode and
					the command line for everything else.
					With VSCode, you can actually open a terminal up inside the program itself.
					You'll need to install the packages <code>gcc</code>, <code>g++</code>, <code>gdb</code>, <code>git</code>, and <code>make</code> for
					this tutorial, so <code>sudo [package manager] install gcc g++ gdb git make</code>, where
					you'll have to use the <code>[package manager]</code> for your distro.
					The package managers are <code>apt</code> for the Debian family (Ubuntu, Mint, XUbuntu,
					Debian, etc.), <code>rpm</code> for Fedora, <code>yum</code> for CentOS, <code>zypper</code>/<code>rpm</code> for openSUSE,
					<code>urpmi</code> for Mandriva, and <code>pacman</code> for <code>Arch</code>.
					If you don't know, it's most likely <code>apt</code>, then <code>rpm</code>, and then <code>yum</code>, but you
					can search "[distro] how to install packages" online if you can't figure it out.
				</p>
				<h3 id="macos">MacOS</h3>
				<p>If you're on Mac, you should probably use XCode or anything that works on Linux.
					MacOS also has a terminal that works almost exactly like the Linux terminal
					(both were based of the Unix System), so you can use a decent text editor and
					the terminal just like in Linux.
					In the terminal, type the command <code>brew install gcc g++ gdb git make</code> to install
					the necessary programs to compile in <code>C</code>.
				</p>
				<h2 id="which-ide-does-the-author-use">Which IDE Does the Author Use?</h2>
				<p>I use Linux, so I use <code>gcc</code> in the terminal with a separate text editor and a
					project file known as a <code>Makefile</code>, which is what you will use if you set up the
					<a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/tutorial-install-linux-on-windows-wsl/">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> (Seriously read that tutorial.).
					The command line also serves as my file manager, code executor, debugger, and
					everything else.
					The file manager and the code executor are some of the basic functions of the
					terminal, while the debugger is a separate command line program, <code>gdb</code>.
				</p>
				<h2 id="compiling-on-the-command-line">Compiling on the Command Line</h2>
				<p>The command is pretty simple for right now, though we're going to add more to it
					later.
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre><span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#3734E2;">joseph@tutorials</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#FF0070;">~/dev</span></b>$ cd [folder with your .c files]</span>
<span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#3734E2;">joseph@tutorials</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#FF0070;">~/dev/hello-world/</span></b>$ gcc [files you want to compile] -o [name of executable]</span>
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>For example, let's say we want to compile this simple program (don't worry about
					the specific function, it will be covered in the next article) that will just
					print out <code>"Hello, World!\n"</code>.
					Furthermore, let's call this file <code>test.c</code>.

				<p>To compile this file, use the command
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre>
<span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#3734E2;">joseph@tutorials</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#FF0070;">~/dev/hello-world/</span></b>$ gcc test.c -o hello-world</span>
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>Then, to execute it, we can use <code>./</code> followed by the program name (which
					shouldn't have any spaces in its name).
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre>
<span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#3734E2;">joseph@tutorials</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#FF0070;">~/dev/hello-world/</span></b>$ ./hello-world</span>
Hello, World!

				</div>
				<p>If you make changes to the source file <code>test.c</code>, then you will have to recompile
					using the same exact command you used to compile <code>test.c</code> last time.

				<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
				<p>I want to emphasize again that only whether you can compile your code, run your
					code on the target system, debug your code, and manage your files matters when
					choosing an IDE.
					Other than that, most IDEs share probably 95% of the things you would want in an
					IDE, so the choice is over the 5% of features that could probably make it easier
					for you to code.
					For this tutorial, we're going to be focused on using a terminal with an
					external text editor since
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>you either have a terminal built into your OS (Linux and MacOS) or you can
						emulate a terminal using the Windows Subsystem for Linux or a virtual machine,
					</li>
					<li>the best IDE for Windows, Visual Studio, barely supports <code>C</code> (if we were
						learning in <code>C++</code>, I would absolutely recommend it),
					</li>
					<li>setting up any of the IDEs mentioned in this article for <code>C</code> development is
						harder than using a command line,
					</li>
					<li>knowing the command line is a much better skill to have than knowing the
						location of the right button to build a project (though you should still know
						the terms <b>Build</b>, <b>Rebuild</b>, <b>Clean</b>, and <b>Compile</b>) or
						where to change a specific setting,
					</li>
					<li>and I would have to spend time on at least three articles for each IDE that most
						readers won't read simply because they'll only need to install one IDE.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>though we will try to indicate where and how to compile programs using other
					IDEs.
					If anyone wants to write an article on setting up a specific IDE for <code>C</code> and
					writing programs in it, contact us at <a
					href="mailto:thetuacm@gmail.com">thetuacm@gmail.com</a> and we can talk more
					about it.
				</p>
				<h2 id="whats-next">What's Next</h2>
				<p>Now that we have a way to compile our programs, we're going to finish talking
					about files in <a href="../files-2/">Files in C, Pt. 2</a>.
					After we finish talking about files, we're going to start using them to write
					the word counter.
