				<h2 id="limited-number-of-digits">Limited Number of Digits</h2>
				<p>I'm going to describe a scenario that's weird to humans but that your computer
					actually has to do all the time.
				</p>
				<p>Let's say that you have a 200 page book with exactly 50 000 words, and I ask you
					to tell me what the 37 420<sup>th</sup> word is.
					To make it easier for you, the author of the book wrote the number of words on
					each page at the bottom of the page, since the number of words can vary from
					page to page.
					To determine the actual word, you would have to keep a running total of the
					number of words you've seen so far, stop as soon as your total goes above 37
					420, and then count words from the beginning of the page until you reach the
					word.
				</p>
				<p>Now, let me make a small change.
					Let's say you have a 200 page book with exactly 50 000 words <b>and exactly 250
					words on every page</b>, and I ask you to tell me what the 37 420<sup>th</sup>
					word is.
					Well, the first page is going to have 250 words on it, the first two pages will
					have 500 words, the first three pages will have 750 words, etc., so the 37
					420<sup>th</sup> word will be the <code>(37 420 % 250) + 1</code>&rArr;<code>171</code><sup>th</sup>
					word on page <code>(37 420 / 250) + 1</code>&rArr;<code>150</code>.
					Now, instead of having to go through more than a hundred pages and keep a total
					of the number of words so far, you can now just flip to page 150 and find the
					171<sup>th</sup> word.
				</p>
				<p>As you can see, when the pages have a fixed number of words on them, finding an
					arbitrary word given an index is quick and easy.
					Types in a lot of high performance languages will have a fixed number of bytes
					for the same exact reason.
					If we don't, the computer either won't know when the number ends or will have to
					waste time trying to figure out when the number ends.
				</p>
				<p>By making the types have a fixed number of bytes, we limit the number of
					possible values we can represent.
					For example, if we have a type one byte long, then that type can only represent
					<i>2<sup>8</sup>=256</i> different values.
				</p>
				<h2 id="signed-vs-unsigned">Signed vs Unsigned</h2>
				<p>We have to make a distinction between signed and unsigned integers before we go
					any further.
					<b>Signed integers</b> can represent <b>zero, positive numbers, and negative
					numbers</b> and <b>unsigned integers</b> can only represent <b>zero and positive
					numbers</b>.
				</p>
				<p>If you want to count the number of people who visited your webpage, you only
					want positive numbers since you can't get a negative number of views.
					If you have a rating system that allows people to upvote and downvote posts,
					then you want both positive and negative numbers for the net upvotes.
					If you just want negative numbers, add a '<code>-</code>' in front of an unsigned number
					when you write your results.
				</p>
				<p>Since we want people to use the right type for the job, we'll allow people to
					use signed and unsigned versions of the <code>int</code>.
					We'll let <code>int</code> represent signed integers and <code>unsigned int</code> represent unsigned
					integers.
				</p>
				<h2 id="binary-representation">Binary Representation</h2>
				<p>As you already know, computers don't understand anything except <code>on</code> and <code>off</code>,
					which we generally abbrieviate with <code>1</code> and <code>0</code>.
					For us to represent something any numeric types, we have to work with this
					constraint.
					We should also be able to handle arithmetic as efficently as possible, so we
					should pick a good representation.
					To see why picking a good representation for you number system is important, see
					how long you can multiply <i>MMMCDLXXXIII</i> and <i>MMCMXVIII</i> without
					giving up.
				</p>
				<p>To start out, we're just going to say that we can use eight bits (a.k.a. a byte)
					to represent a number, which means
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>We can only represent <i>2<sup>8</sup>=256</i> different numbers since we only
						have eight bits, just as we could only represent <i>10<sup>4</sup>=10 000</i>
						different numbers if we have four digits.
					</li>
					<li>Because we want to represent as many different numbers as possible, each number
						should only have one binary representation.
					</li>
					<li>Because we want to be consistent, there should be exactly one base ten number
						for each binary representation
					</li>
					<li>If <code>a &bull; b</code>&rArr;<code>c</code> in base ten (where <code>&bull;</code> is an arbitrary arithmetic
						operation), the binary representations of <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> should also satisfy
						<code>a &bull; b</code>&rArr;<code>c</code>.
					</li>
					<li>In our representation <code>a &bull; b</code> should be quick to calculate, where <code>&bull;</code>
						is any arithmetic operation.
					</li>
					<li>Determining if <code>a &gt; b</code> should be quick.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h3 id="unsigned-types">Unsigned Types</h3>
				<p>Since we have 256 possible numbers and we want to represent all the positive
					numbers we can and zero, we can just let the binary representation of a number
					be the number in base two and the resulting binary representations will satisfy
					everything an unsigned type should satisfy, meaning we'll represent the numbers
					from <code>0</code> to <code>255</code>.
					Converting from base ten to binary is trivial, so I'm not going to rehash it
					here.
					If you need a more in-depth explanation, check <a
					href="https://blog.angularindepth.com/the-simple-math-behind-decimal-binary-conversion-algorithms-d30c967c9724">this
					article</a>.
				</p>
				<p>Since the algorithms for arithmetic in binary are just like the algorithms in
					base ten, we can just use the normal algorithms for arithmetic.
				</p>
				<h3 id="overflow">Overflow</h3>
				<p>Since we can represent all the numbers from <code>0</code> to <code>255</code>, we should be able to
					represent the result of any arithmetic operation so long as the result is
					between <code>0</code> and <code>255</code>.
					For example:
				</p>
				<code>
					<table class="arithmetic-table">
						<tr>
							<th>Binary</th>
							<th></th>
							<th>Base 10</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>111&nbsp;</td>
							<td style="width: 2ch"></td>
							<td>1&nbsp;</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>0010 0101</td>
							<td style="width: 2ch"></td>
							<td>37</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="math-line">+ 0001
							0011</td>
							<td style="width: 2ch"></td>
							<td class="math-line">+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>0011 1000</td>
							<td style="width: 2ch"></td>
							<td>56</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</code>
				<p>We will have a problem, however, if the result is greater than <code>255</code> or less
					than <code>0</code>.
					For example, let's calculate <code>255 + 1</code>.
				</p>
				<code>
					<table class="arithmetic-table">
						<tr>
							<td>1 1111 111&nbsp;</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1111 1111</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="math-line">+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0000 0001</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><s>1</s> 0000 0000</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</code>
				<p>Since we only have eight bits we just drop the ninth bit, meaning <code>255 +
					1</code>&rArr;<code>0</code>.
					Since <code>a + b</code>&rArr;<code>c</code> means <code>c - b</code>&rArr;<code>a</code> by the basic rules of algebra,
					<code>255 + 1</code>&rArr;<code>0</code> means <code>0 - 1</code>&rArr;<code>255</code>.
					In general, <b>if you go above the highest number we can represent, you'll loop
					back around to the lowest number we can represent</b>, and, <b>if you go below
					the lowest number we can represent, you'll loop back around to the highest
					number we can represent</b>.
				</p>
				<h3 id="signed-types">Signed Types</h3>
				<p>With signed Types, we also need to satisfy a few other constraints, such as:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>For every number, we should be able to represent its negative.
					</li>
					<li><code>-a + a</code>&rArr;<code>0</code>, since that's how you define the negative (a.k.a. additive
						inverse) of a number without changing how the computer adds numbers based on the
						sign.
					</li>
					<li>Determining if a number is negative or positive should be quick.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h4 id="what-numbers-will-we-represent">What Numbers Will We Represent?</h4>
				<p>Before we can come up with a representation for something, we need to establish
					what we're representing.
					In our case, we need to figure out what numbers we want to represent.
				</p>
				<p>We want <code>0</code> since <code>0</code> is pretty useful, so let's include it.
					Since <code>0</code> is its own inverse and we only want one binary representation for each
					number, we don't need to include a "negative zero".
					We'll also want <code>1</code>, so we'll include <code>1</code>.
					Since we want to be able to represent the negative of every number we add to the
					list, we'll also have to include <code>-1</code>.
					Let's also add <code>2</code> and <code>-2</code> into the list, <code>3</code> and <code>-3</code> to the list, and so on
					until we run out of numbers.
				</p>
				<p>After adding <code>127</code> and <code>-127</code>, we have a problem: we only have one more binary
					representation available.
					If we added <code>128</code> and <code>-128</code>, we would have to represent 257 different numbers,
					which we can't do since we've run out of space.
					Since <code>0</code> is its own inverse, we don't want to include it twice, and we can only
					have <i>2<sup>n</sup></i> binary representations, we will never be able to
					completely represent a consecutive series of numbers centered around <code>0</code>.
					Since it's only one number, though, we won't have to worry.
				</p>
				<p>Right now, since we don't really know what to do with the last number, we're
					just going to say that we definitely want to represent every integer from <code>-127</code>
					to <code>127</code>.
					We'll determine the last number we want to represent when we figure out how
					we're going to represent our numbers.
				</p>
				<h4 id="choosing-an-efficient-representation">Choosing an Efficient Representation</h4>
				<p>As I showed earlier when I asked you to multiply two numbers in Roman numerals,
					choosing a good representation for numbers will help you do math quickly and
					effectively.
					Ideally, we would like to use the same exact algorithms for arithmetic
					operations for signed and unsigned integers so that we don't have to have
					separate hardware for signed and unsigned operations.
					Since using the number in base two works for all the nonnegative numbers, let's
					keep that system for all the nonnegative numbers, meaning <code>0000 0000</code> is <code>0</code>,
					<code>0000 0001</code> is <code>1</code>, <code>0000 0010</code> is <code>2</code>, ..., and <code>0111 1111</code> is <code>127</code>.
				</p>
				<p>We have a problem, though.
					While representing something like <code>81</code> as <code>0101 0001</code> is all fine and good, how
					do we represent <code>-81</code>?
				</p>
				<h4 id="taking-the-negative">Taking the Negative</h4>
				<p>Remember, taking the negative of a number <code>a</code> produces another number <code>-a</code> such
					that <code>-a + a</code>&rArr;<code>0</code>.
					To figure out what <code>-a</code> is, we'll use the equivalent statement <code>0 -
					a</code>&rArr;<code>-a</code>.
					First, we'll figure out the representation for <code>-1</code>.
					Since we want to use the same exact algorithms for arithmetic, we'll subtract
					<code>1</code> from <code>0</code> just like we normally would.
				</p>
				<p>Doing the subtraction yields
				</p>
				<code>
					<table class="arithmetic-table">
						<tr>
							<td><sup>1</sup><s>0</s><sup>1</sup><s>0</s><sup>1</sup><s>0</s><sup>1</sup><s>0</s> <sup>1</sup><s>0</s><sup>1</sup><s>0</s><sup>1</sup><s>0</s><sup>1</sup><s>0</s></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="math-line">-<sup>&nbsp;</sup>0<sup>&nbsp;</sup>0<sup>&nbsp;</sup>0<sup>&nbsp;</sup>0 <sup>&nbsp;</sup>0<sup>&nbsp;</sup>0<sup>&nbsp;</sup>0<sup>&nbsp;</sup>1</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><s>1</s><sup>&nbsp;</sup>1<sup>&nbsp;</sup>1<sup>&nbsp;</sup>1<sup>&nbsp;</sup>1 <sup>&nbsp;</sup>1<sup>&nbsp;</sup>1<sup>&nbsp;</sup>1<sup>&nbsp;</sup>1</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</code>
				<p>where we drop the leftmost <code>1</code> from the result since we can't store it anywhere
					and doing anything else requires us to modify our addition algorithm.
				</p>
				<p>If we add the binary representations for <code>-1</code> and <code>1</code>, we'll get <code><s>1</s> 0000
					0000</code>, which overflows to <code>0</code>, which is exactly the behavior we're looking for.
					We now have two ways of figuring out the rest of the negative numbers: subtract
					a positive number from <code>0</code> or multiplying by <code>-1</code>.
					Once we do the calculations, we'll find that <code>-2</code> is <code>1111 1110</code>, <code>-3</code> is <code>1111
					1101</code>, ..., and <code>-127</code> is <code>1000 0001</code>.
				</p>
				<p>We could also express <code>-a</code> as <code>-1 - a + 1</code>, which may be easier to understand.
					For example to calculate <code>-81</code>:
				</p>
				<code>
					<table class="arithmetic-table">
						<tr>
							<th>Binary</th>
							<th></th>
							<th>Base 10</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1111 1111</td>
							<td style="width: 2ch"></td>
							<td>-1</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td style="text-align: right; border-bottom: 1px solid #000000;">- 0101 0001</td>
							<td style="width: 2ch"></td>
							<td style="text-align: right; border-bottom: 1px solid #000000;">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1010 1110</td>
							<td style="width: 2ch"></td>
							<td>-82</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="math-line">+ 0000 0001</td>
							<td style="width: 2ch"></td>
							<td class="math-line">+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1010 1111</td>
							<td style="width: 2ch"></td>
							<td>-81</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</code>
				<p>The new <code>-1 - a + 1</code> process we came up with is equivalent to <b>flipping the
					bits (replacing zeros with ones and ones with zeros) and adding one</b>, which
					is how people normally describe taking the negative of a number in this system.
				</p>
				<p>We've set up a system called <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">two's complement</a>,
					and it's the standard on the overwhelming majority on most computers since IBM
					released the System/360 in 1964.
					The only other options at the time were "one's compliment", in which you just
					flipped the bits to get the negative of a number, and the "sign-magnitude"
					format, in which you use the leftmost bit to represent the sign and you use the
					other bits to represent the absolute value.
				</p>
				<p>One's compliment suffered from several problems, but the worst was <code>0</code> would
					have two representations: the standard <code>0000 0000</code> and <code>1111 1111</code>.
					Since zero could be coded using either representation, you would have to check
					both representations whenever you wanted to make a comparison with zero.
				</p>
				<p>The sign-magnitude format also has two representations for <code>0</code> (<code>0000 0000</code> and
					<code>1000 0000</code>), but checking if a number is zero is pretty easy since you can just
					ignore the leftmost bit entirely.
					Other than checking for zero, however, the sign-magnitude format requires you to
					turn addition into subtraction and vice versa and switch the order of the
					numbers you're adding or subtracting depending on the sign.
				</p>
				<h4 id="benefits-of-twos-compliment">Benefits of Two's Compliment</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Every number has one binary representation and every binary representation
						represents one number.
					</li>
					<li>Adding signed and unsigned numbers works in exactly the same way.
					</li>
					<li>Negative numbers work exactly as they should.
					</li>
					<li>All negative numbers will have a <code>1</code> as the most significant (leftmost) bit and
						all non-negative numbers will have a <code>0</code> as the most significant bit.
					</li>
					<li>Determining whether a number is greater than or less than a number is easy,
						since you can just subtract the two numbers and look at the most significant
						bit (a &gt;.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h4 id="the-missing-number">The Missing Number</h4>
				<p>We've established that we're going to use two's complement to represent our
					integers and that we are definitely going to represent the integers from <code>-127</code>
					to <code>127</code>, but we're still missing one number.
					We can't have a representation we don't know how to interpret, or else our
					program could fail.
				</p>
				<h5 id="finding-the-missing-number">Finding the Missing Number</h5>
				<p>To figure out how to deal with the missing number, we're going to first find out
					which binary representation hasn't been used yet and then we're going to use
					the properties of the binary representation to figure out what it should be.
				</p>
				<p>We could do this by going through all the numbers from <code>0</code> to <code>127</code>, finding
					their negatives, but that would take too long.
					Plus, it's no fun.
					Since we can flip all the bits and add one to any binary representation, we know
					that we can negate the binary representation of the missing number.
					The missing number, however, can't have any of the numbers from <code>-127</code> to <code>127</code>
					as its negative since each of them already have a negative and the negative of a
					negative is the original number.
				</p>
				<p>Putting all this together means that when we negate the missing number, we have
					to end up with the number itself.
					Since the number is its own negative, adding it to itself must equal zero, and
					since adding the number to itself is equivalent to multiplying by 2 (<code>10</code> in
					binary) and multiplying by 2 will be easier in this case, we're going to
					multiply by two.
					Let's represent the missing number by <code>abcd efgh</code>, where each letter represents
					an unknown digit.
				</p>
				<code>
					<table class="arithmetic-table">
						<tr>
							<td>abcd efgh</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="math-line">x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>0</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="math-line">a bcde fgh0</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><s>a</s> bcde fgh0</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</code>
				<p>For <code>abcd efgh</code> to be its own inverse <code>bcde fgh0</code> must equal <code>0000 0000</code>,
					meaning the missing number must be <code>a000 0000</code>.
					Since <code>a</code> can only be a <code>0</code> or a <code>1</code> and <code>0000 0000</code> is zero, <code>1000 0000</code> must
					be the representation for the missing number.
				</p>
				<h5 id="what-number-does-1000-0000-represent">What Number Does <code>1000 0000</code> Represent?</h5>
				<p>The missing number is kind of weird since it's its own negative and not zero.
					If we subtract one, we will end up with <code>127</code>, so maybe it should be <code>127</code>.
					If we add one to it, however, we will end up with <code>1000 0001</code>, which is <code>-127</code>
					(to see it for yourself, negate <code>1000 0001</code> and convert from binary to base 10).
					Our choices are either the number one more than <code>127</code> or the number one less
					than <code>-127</code>, which are <code>128</code> and <code>-128</code>.
				</p>
				<p>Note that the most significant bit (leftmost digit) is a <code>1</code>.
					If we were to make it positive, it would be the only positive number that starts
					with a <code>1</code>.
					As a general principle, every special case you have to check will make your
					program more inefficient, and making <code>1000 0000</code> positive would be a special
					case, so let's just make it negative.
				</p>
				<p>Since we've decided that our missing number will be negative, <code>1000 0000</code> will
					represent <code>-128</code>.
				</p>
				<h1 id="what-if-we-want-to-represent-larger-numbers">What if We Want to Represent Larger Numbers?</h1>
				<p>The system we set up works identically with more bits.
					If we want unsigned numbers, we use the number in base two as the number's
					binary representation, and we can represent numbers from <i>0</i> to
					<i>2<sup>n</sup></i> with <i>n</i> bits.
					If we want signed numbers, we can represent numbers from <i>-2<sup>n-1</sup></i>
					to <i>2<sup>n-1</sup>-1</i> with <i>n</i> bits, where positive numbers get their
					normal binary representations and negative numbers flip all the bits of their
					corresponding positive numbers and add one.
					<i>0</i> is still <code>0000 ... 0000</code>, <i>1</i> is still <code>0000 ... 0001</code>, <i>-1</i>
					is still <code>1111 ... 1111</code>, <i>2<sup>n-1</sup>-1</i> is still <code>0111 ... 1111</code>, and
					<i>-2<sup>n-1</sup></i> is still <code>1000 ... 0000</code>.
				</p>
				<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
				<p>We explained how computers represent integer numbers using a system called <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">two's complement</a>
					which will allow us to represent integers of any size.
				</p>
				<p>If you're coming from the <i>Making Sense of C</i> series, the next article in
