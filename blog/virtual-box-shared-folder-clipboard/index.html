				<p><i>In this article, we're going to discuss how you can install Virtual Box, a
					Virtual Machine that will allow your computer to run a different operating
					system on your computer without affecting your main computer.
					We'll also cover how to use the same clipboard (i.e., Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V) both on
					your computer and the virtual machine.</i>
				</p>
				<p>Let's say that you want to write a program for Linux on your Windows computer.
					If you want to test the program, you need the ability to run it on a Linux
					system.
					Instead of going out searching for a computer that has Linux installed, you can
					install it yourself.
					You probably don't want to get rid of everything else on your computer just to
					install Linux, though.
					You want some way to install Linux without replacing Windows, which you can do
					by using a <b>Virtual Machine</b>.
					A <b>Virtual Machine</b> (VM) is a program that runs on your computer that
					emulates another program natively on your computer, like a video game emulator.
					In this tutorial, we're going to discuss how to install <b>VirtualBox</b>, a
					virtual machine that will allow you to emulate several operating systems
					including most Linux distros and most versions of Windows,
				</p>
				<h2 id="installing-virtualbox">Installing VirtualBox</h2>
				<p>First, go to the <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox
					Downloads page</a> and download both VirtualBox and the extension pack.
				</p>
				<img src="pics/dl-vbox.png" alt="An arrow points to the section VirtualBox 6.0.4
				Platform Packages and another arrow points to the section VirtualBox 6.0.4
				Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack, which contain links to the packages you
				want to download.">
				<p>The 6.0.4 is just a version number indicating the most recent stable release,
					and will likely change in the future.
				</p>
				<div class="aside" >
					<h5>Installing an Earlier Version and Signing Kernel Modules</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>On the editor's Linux Mint computer, VirtualBox 6.0 didn't work so he used
						VirtualBox 5.2, which you can find on <a
						href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_2">the older
						versions download page</a>.
						He also installed the Extension Pack for Version 5.2, which you can find on the
						same page.
					</p>
					<p>He also had to follow the instructions on <a
						href="https://gist.github.com/reillysiemens/ac6bea1e6c7684d62f544bd79b2182a4">this
						short tutorial on signing VirtualBox Kernel Modules</a> since he was using UEFI
						secure boot and Linux hates programs messing around with important files unless
						the user gives the programs explicit permission.
						A few notes about the tutorial:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>You can use this part of the tutorial and follow the instructions on the
							VirtualBox website for installing VirtualBox.
						</li>
						<li>Every backslash in the command in step 2 can be removed and you can put
							everything on one line.

						</li>
						<li>You can't use the mouse in the blue screen section, just the keyboard.
						</li>
						<li>After the step where you "Select OK to Reboot", you may not see an "OK", but you
							could see an option to reboot that you can select instead.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>Make sure to choose the platform package specific to your system.
				</p>
				<p>After that point, just open the file you downloaded and follow the instructions
					to install VirtualBox on your system.
					You should see a message that says you've installed VirtualBox successfully
					after you're done.
				</p>
				<h2 id="installing-the-extension-pack">Installing the Extension Pack</h2>
				<p>Next, you'll want to start VirtualBox up.
					From there, go to <b>File</b> &gt; <b>Preferences</b> &gt;
					<b>Extensions</b>.
					Click on the down arrow on the blue square to open up a file explorer.
					Then, navigate to the Extension Pack you downloaded, and open it.
					You'll then see a dialog box pop up asking if you want to install the Extension
					Pack, so click <b>Install</b>.
				</p>
				<img src="pics/install-vbox-ext.png" alt="A dialog box saying you have
				successfully installed the VirtualBox Extension Pack">
				<h2 id="setting-up-the-virtual-machine">Setting Up the Virtual Machine</h2>
				<p>First, we're going to create the virtual machine, so we'll click the button that
					says "New".
					From there, we're going to give it a name so we can identify it later.
					We're going to install Xubuntu, which is the Ubuntu Distribution with the XCFE
					window manager instead of the GNOME window manager that comes with Ubuntu by
					default, since it's efficient and high quality.
				</p>
				<img src="pics/create-vm-1.png" alt="A picture of the Create New VM window.">
				<p>As you can see, we gave it the name "My Local Xubuntu VM" (name it whatever you
					want), we left the machine folder untouched, we set the "Type" field to Linux
					and the "Version" field to "Ubuntu (64-bit)".
				</p>
				<p>Now, we're going to have to set some parameters of our virtual machine.
					Since the virtual machine is like its own computer so it needs RAM to function
					properly.
					Our virtual machine will end up taking some RAM from our main computer, but we
					still want most of our RAM reserved for our main computer, so we're going to
					limit the amout of RAM the virtual machine can use.
					Since Xubuntu doesn't need a lot of resources, around 1024&nbsp;MB to
					2048&nbsp;MB of RAM is fine.
					Just make sure that you don't open too many tabs of Google Chrome on the virtual
					machine or anything else that hogs a bunch of RAM.
				</p>
				<p>To be clear, your virtual machine has 1024&nbsp;MB to 2048&nbsp;MB of RAM,
					meaning your virtual machine will be simulating a computer with 1&nbsp;GB to
					2&nbsp;GB of RAM.
					Furthermore, your main computer will then lose however much RAM you give to the
					virtual machine while you're running it.
					If you have 8&nbsp;GB and you give 2&nbsp;GB to your virtual machine, you will
					have 6&nbsp;GB left for your main computer.
				</p>
				<p>Virtual Machines also need memory on the hard drive, so we're going to reserve
					some memory for it on our hard drive.
					We don't have a virtual hard drive yet, so we're going to have to create a new
					one, so click the option to <b>Create a virtual hard disk now</b>.
					After hitting <b>Create</b>, another window will pop up to allow us to create a
					virtual hard disk.
				</p>
				<img src="pics/create-vm-2.png" alt="The VirtualBox window to create a virtual
				hard disk.">
				<p>We're going to select the <b>VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)</b> option and the
					<b>Dynamically Allocated</b> option, which will let the virtual hard drive of
					the virtual machine grow until it reaches a cutoff point, meaning it will start
					out taking up almost no space on the hard drive, but as we save files in the
					virtual machine, it will grow larger.
					As you can see, we set the cutoff point to 32.96&nbsp;GB, so the virtual machine
					will never take up more than 32.96&nbsp;GB of our hard drive.
				</p>
				<p>Hit <b>Create</b> and we're done.
					You should see the virtual machine we created in the start up menu.
				</p>
				<img src="pics/create-vm-3.png" alt="The start up menu after we created the
				virtual machine. Notice that 'My Local Xubuntu VM' or whatever you named it
				shows up.">
				<h2 id="downloading-xubuntu">Downloading Xubuntu</h2>
				<p>Installing most Linux distros requires you to download an <code>.iso</code> file, which
					contains all the installation information.
					We're going to download the <code>.iso</code> file from a <b>mirror</b>, which is a copy of
					a web resource (like a video, website, or <code>.iso</code> file) hosted on a different
					server.
					Since Xubuntu is being downloaded by people all over the world, we need multiple
					servers in a bunch of places to efficently send information about installation
					and updates.
					Since we're writing this article in the United States, we're going to download
					from the United States mirror.
				</p>
				<img src="pics/dl-xubuntu-1.png" alt="The Download page for the xubuntu website
				should have a list of mirrors based on countries, and we'll pick the one that
				says 'United States'.">
				<p>Anyway, we're going to follow the <a
					href="https://xubuntu.org/download/">instructions on how to download
					Xubuntu</a>.
					If you want a different Linux distro, feel free to download any distro you want.
					You can either choose to download the <code>.iso</code> file from a mirror or use a torrent
					download.
					Mirrors are easier to use but torrents are much faster, so the choice is up to
					you.
					Regardless of what you choose, we're going to want to download the <code>xubuntu-[version]-desktop-amd64.iso</code>
					file if we're using a mirror or we're going to want to download the
					<code>xubuntu-[version]-desktop-amd64.iso.torrent</code> file if we want to use a torrent, where the current
					<code>[version]</code> as of this article was <code>18.04</code>, so we downloaded
					<code>xubuntu-18.04-desktop-amd64.iso</code>.
				</p>
				<div class="aside" >
					The <code>-amd64.iso</code> file is for 64 bit computers and the <code>-i386.iso</code> is for 32 bit
					computers.
					Unless you're running an old computer, you have a 64 bit computer.
				</div>
				<img src="pics/dl-xubuntu-2.png" alt="A picture of the Xubuntu download screen
				with a red rectangle around the .iso file.">
				<p>If you downloaded the <code>.iso</code> file from the mirror, then we can move on.
					If you downloaded the <code>.iso.torrent</code> file, then you'll need to torrent download
					the <code>.iso</code> file, then we can move on.
					Once again, only use the <code>.iso.torrent</code> file if you know how to torrent
					download.
				</p>
				<h2 id="adding-the-iso-file-to-the-virtual-machine">Adding the <code>.iso</code> File to the Virtual Machine</h2>
				<p>Normally, when you install an operating system, you store the operating system
					in some removable media (like a USB or a CD) and then you boot (start up
					your computer) using the removable media.
					We don't have a physical USB port or an optical drive (a CD tray) on our virtual
					machine, so VirtualBox has to provide some way for us to emulate them.
					We can access our emulated optical drive by clicking on our VM (My Local Xubuntu
					VM), clicking on the <b>Settings</b> button (should be in the same row as the
					<b>New</b> button we clicked earlier), clicking on <b>Storage</b>, then clicking
					on <b>Empty</b> under <b>Controller:IDE</b> in the <b>Storage Devices</b> box,
					clicking on the <b>CD</b> icon, then clicking on <b>Choose Virtual Optical Disk
					File</b>.
				</p>
				<img src="pics/input-iso-1.png" alt="The window after clicking on Storage with
				an arrow pointing to the CD icon.">
				<p>From there, we just have to find the <code>.iso</code> file we downloaded (which should be
					in <b>Downloads</b> unless you did something weird), click it and then click
					open.
				</p>
				<img src="pics/input-iso-2.png" alt="The file explorer with the .iso file
				selected.">
				<p>Afterwards, we should see exactly what we saw earlier after navigating to
					Storage in VirtualBox's settings but with <b>Empty</b> replaced with <code>xubuntu-18.04-desktop-amd64.iso</code>.
				</p>
				<p>From here, hit <b>OK</b> and we should be good to go to set up Xubuntu.
				</p>
				<h2 id="setting-up-xubuntu">Setting Up Xubuntu</h2>
				<p>After hitting <b>OK</b>, you should be back at the start up screen and you
					should see My Local Xubuntu VM on the left.
				</p>
				<img src="pics/create-vm-3.png" alt="The start up menu after we created the
				virtual machine. Notice that 'My Local Xubuntu VM' or whatever you named it
				shows up.">
				<p>Hit <b>Start</b>, and you should see a screen like this:
				</p>
				<img src="pics/install-xubuntu-1.png" alt="The first install screen for setting
				up Xubuntu, which offers you the choice of installing or trying it out.">
				<p>Pick your installation language on the left and then click the <b>Install
					Xubuntu</b> button.
					From there, pick your keyboard layout.
				</p>
				<img src="pics/install-xubuntu-2.png" alt="The keyboard layout screen.">
				<p>Then, check both boxes to <b>Download updates while installing Xubuntu</b> and
					to <b>Install third party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware and
					additional media formats</b> on the next screen.
				</p>
				<img src="pics/install-xubuntu-3.png" alt="Updates and installation of third
				party software while installing Xubuntu screen.">
				<p>Then, don't bother with anything (including encryption and LVM) except the
					<b>Erase Disk and Install Xubuntu</b> option.
				</p>
				<img src="pics/install-xubuntu-4.png" alt="Options to erase disk and install
				Xubuntu and to set up encryption and LVM.">
				<p>A popup will appear asking if you're sure that you want to erase the disk, which
					you do since it's empty anyways.
				</p>
				<img src="pics/install-xubuntu-5.png" alt="The popup saying 'If you continue,
				the changes listed below will be written to the disks...'.">
				<p>After that, you'll select your time zone.
					Then, you'll select your username, computer name (how other computers will see
					your computer), and your password.
					We decided to have our username as "johndoe" and our computer name as
					"johndoe-comp".
					You'll also want to require your password to log in for security reasons.
				</p>
				<p>From there, hit <b>Continue</b> and wait until the installation finishes.
					You should see a window pop up telling you installation is complete and that
					you'll have to restart your computer.
					Hit <b>Restart Now</b>.
					If you see something saying <b>Remove Installation Disk, then Reboot</b>, you
					need to "eject" the installation disk, which I did by shutting down the virtual
					machine (closing the window), then going into the <a
					href="#adding-the-iso-file-to-the-virtual-machine">settings where we added the
					<code>.iso</code> file into storage</a>, clicking on the <b>CD icon</b> and clicking the
					option to remove the disk.
					If you do it correctly, you should see that <code>xubuntu-18.04-desktop-amd64.iso</code> has been replaced with
					<code>Empty</code>.
				</p>
				<p>From there, go back to the start menu and restart your virtual machine.
					Once you do, let it load up and it will eventually get to a log in screen, which
					takes the password you created in this step.
					We have successfully made a working virtual machine!
				</p>
				<h2 id="updating-software">Updating Software</h2>
				<p>If you see an prompt to update software, ignore it.
					We're going to use the terminal to update our software since it's more powerful.
					Go into apps (it's a button with the Xubuntu logo into the top left corner of
					the screen that works just like hitting the Windows icon in the bottom left
					corner of the screen) and select <b>Terminal</b> or <b>Terminal Emulator</b>.
				</p>
				<img src="pics/up-vm-3.png" alt="The Xubuntu logo working just like the Windows
				icon with the Terminal Emulator selected.">
				<p>Doing so will open a terminal that looks like

				<p>The first two lines will only be displayed the first time you open a terminal.
				</p>
				<p>After this point, we're just going to display the black box in the terminal
					window.
				</p>
				<p>At this point, I would recommend opening this webpage in your VM on Firefox (you
					can install Chrome later) so that you can copy the commands into the terminal
					from within the VM.
					Later in the article, we're going to show you how to make a shared clipboard
					that will allow you to copy and paste between the host computer and the VM.
				</p>
				<p>First, we're going to want to update all the programs on our computer, so we'll
					use the commands <code>sudo apt update</code> to figure out everything that needs to be
					updated and <code>sudo apt upgrade</code> to update everything.
					The <code>sudo</code> command is equivalent to <code>Run As Administrator</code> on Windows and <code>apt</code>
					is a <b>package manager</b>, which manages what software you're running on your
					computer.
					Whenever you run a command with <code>sudo</code> at the front, you're going to get a line
					that says <code>[sudo] password for johndoe:</code>, at which point you need to type your
					user password for the account.
					If you run two commands with <code>sudo</code> in a short time, you probably won't have to
					type it in the second time.

					In our case, our <code>[username]</code> is <code>johndoe</code> and our <code>[version_number]</code> is
					<code>6.0.4</code>, so we typed <code>cd /media/johndoe/VBox_GAs_6.0.4</code>.

					<h5><code>Tab</code> Autocomplete</h5>
					<hr>
					If you don't know the version off the top of your head, hit the <code>Tab</code> key while
					typing it in and it will autocomplete for you if possible or display every way
					it could autocomplete what you've typed in.
					For example,
					<div class="terminal"><pre>
<span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">johndoe@johndoe-comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">~</span></b>$ cd ~</span>
<span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">johndoe@johndoe-comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">~</span></b>$ ls Do</span>
Documents/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downloads/
<span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">johndoe@johndoe-comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">~</span></b>$ ls Downloads</span>
<span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">johndoe@johndoe-comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">~</span></b>$</span>
</pre>
					</div>
					<p>After moving to <code>~</code>, your home directory (it's directly analogous to
						<code>C:\Users\[username]</code> on a Windows computer), we start typing <code>ls Do</code> (let's say
						we want to see everything in our Downloads folder), then we hit <code>Tab</code> to
						autocomplete.
						Since both <code>Documents</code> and <code>Downloads</code> start with <code>Do</code>, the terminal doesn't
						know which one you want, so it prints out both <code>Documents/</code> and <code>Downloads/</code>.
						Then if we type <code>ls Dow</code> and then hit <code>Tab</code>, it will autocomplete to <code>ls
						Downloads</code>.
						We can then hit enter and see that we don't have any files in <code>Downloads</code>, so
						<code>ls Downloads</code> won't print anything out.
					</p>
					<p>In our case, we can type in <code>cd /media/</code> and hit <code>Tab</code> a few times and it will
						be the correct directory.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>Type <code>ls</code> to print out all the files in the current directory and make sure you
					have files and folders that look like these:
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre><span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">johndoe@johndoe-comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">~</span></b>$ cd /media/johndoe/VBox_GAs_6.0.4</span>
<span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">johndoe@johndoe-comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">/media/johndoe/VBox_GAs_6.0.4</span></b>$ ls</span>

</pre>
				</div>
				<p>Then, we're going to execute the <code>VBoxLinuxAdditions.run</code> file using the syntax
					<code>./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run</code>.
					Since we're messing around with system files, we need to use <code>sudo</code> to tell the

				<h2 id="creating-a-shared-folder">Creating a Shared Folder</h2>
				<p>Now that we've set up our virtual machine, we need to create some way for us to
					share files between them, so let's create a shared folder.
					First, we're going to need to go to our host machine (your original operating
					system) and create a folder.
					It doesn't matter where we create it or what we named it, so long as we know
					where we created it and what we named it.
					We decided to create a folder called <code>vm-shared</code> in the directory
					<code>/Users/nikitazdvijkov/Documents/</code>.
				</p>
				<p>Now, we need to go back to our VirtualBox settings for My Local Xubuntu VM.
				</p>
				<img src="pics/create-vm-3.png" alt="The start up menu after we created the
				virtual machine.">
				<p>Click on <b>My Local Xubuntu VM</b>, then click on <b>Settings</b>, then
					<b>Shared Folders</b>, then click the <b>Folder with a Plus</b> button, then
					type the path and the folder name into the box that says <b>Folder Path:</b>.
					You can also use the arrow on the right of that box to browse through the file
					manager on your system and select the folder.
					Then, select the options to <b>Auto-mount</b> and <b>Make Permanent</b>, then
					hit <b>OK</b>.
				</p>
				<img src="pics/sf-1.png" alt="The Shared Folders popup after hitting the Folder
				with a Plus button.">
				<p>You should then see the folder in the list of shared folders with <b>Access</b>
					set to <b>Full</b> and <b>Auto Mount</b> set to <b>Yes</b>.
					Also, note the name that shows up in <b>Name</b> column, which we will use later
					as <code>[name]</code>.
				</p>
				<p>As a test, let's create a text file in the shared folder on our host system and
					see if we can access it from the virtual machine.
					You can use any code editor (e.g. Sublime), Notepad, etc. you want, just save it
					as some sort of text file.
				</p>
				<p>Now, we should be able to access the shared folder in <code>/media/sf_[name]</code>, so
					let's try <code>cd /media/sf_[name]</code>.
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre><span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">johndoe@johndoe-comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">/media/johndoe/VBox_GAs_6.0.4</span></b>$ cd /media/sf_vm-shared</span>
bash: cd: sf_vm-shared: Permission denied
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>We need to tell the computer that <code>johndoe</code> has permission to access the folder,
					so we'll need to add <code>johndoe</code> to the list of users that have access to the
					folder, which we can do using <code>sudo adduser johndoe vboxsf</code>.
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre><span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">johndoe@johndoe-comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">/media/johndoe/VBox_GAs_6.0.4</span></b>$ sudo adduser johndoe vboxsf</span>
Adding user `johndoe' to group `vboxsf' ...
Adding user johndoe to group vboxsf
Done.
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>After adding <code>johndoe</code> to <code>vboxsf</code>, we have to log out and log back in again to
					see a change, so log out by clicking the <b>Xubuntu icon</b> at the top left of
					the screen that you used to open the terminal, then click the <b>Power
					Button</b> on the screen, then click the <b>Log Out Button</b>.
					Wait a few seconds, and you should end up back at the log in screen.
					Type in your password.
					Once you've logged in, open up another terminal and try <code>cd /media/sf_vm-shared</code>
					again and it should work.
					If you type <code>ls</code> afterwards, then you should be able to see the text file you
					created in the shared folder on your host machine.
				</p>
				<div class="terminal"><pre><span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">johndoe@johndoe-comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">~</span></b>$ cd /media/sf_vm-shared</span>
<span class="terminal-oneline"><b><span style="color:#4CE64C;">johndoe@johndoe-comp</span></b>:<b><span style="color:#298FDD;">/media/sf_vm-shared</span></b>$ ls</span>
test.txt
</pre>
				</div>
				<p>Note that it doesn't matter what directory you're in when you type <code>cd
					/media/sf_vm-shared</code>.
				</p>
				<p>Now, if you want to edit or run a file on both your VM and your host computer,
					move the file into <code>/media/sf_vm-shared</code>.
				</p>
				<h2 id="setting-up-a-shared-clipboard">Setting Up a Shared Clipboard</h2>
				<p>A shared clipboard means you can use Ctrl+C to copy text on your host computer
					and Ctrl+V to paste it on your VM, and vice versa.
					For example, you've probably noticed that you can't copy and paste the commands
					from the article on the host machine into the terminal.
					It's quite easy to fix.
					In your VM, click <b>Devices</b> at the top of the window, then to <b>Shared
					Clipboard</b>, then click <b>Bidirectional</b> and you should be done.
				</p>
				<img src="pics/create-vm-3.png" alt="The start up menu after we created the
				virtual machine.">
				<p>From here, click on <b>My Local Xubuntu VM</b>, then <b>Settings</b>, then
					<b>General</b>, then click on the <b>Advanced</b> tab, then click on the box
					next to <b>Shared Clipboard:</b> and select <b>Bidirectional</b> from the
					drop down menu.
					You might need to log out on the VM or turn the VM off and back on again, but it
					will work after a bit.
					You can also change the settings in the VirtualBox startup menu.
				</p>
				<p>Either method worked on the editor's Linux host computer, but the second method
					is more likely to work on the author's Mac host computer.

				<div class="aside" >
					<h5>Copying From and Pasting Into the Terminal</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>In the terminal, "Ctrl+C" is reserved for stopping a program running in the
						terminal and "Ctrl+V" is reserved for "verbatim input", meaning that it will
						write out the literal character that comes after it, such as the "Esc" key.
					</p>
					<p>Regardless, "Ctrl+C" and "Ctrl+V" are reserved for other things, so you have to
						use "Ctrl+Shift+C" and "Ctrl+Shift+V" to copy and paste things from the
						terminal.
